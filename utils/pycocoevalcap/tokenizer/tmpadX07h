This is a very poignant photograph I believe you accomplished your goals very well I have dealt with the same subject and emotions in a few of my photos and really appreciate this image
It seems a logical subject for bw  excellent document of this architectural graphic
Needs to have the subject lightened up just a tad but otherwise nicely done
Heres a road less travelled Purposefully static empty and cold  A lonely soul in an empty  cold world  Thats what I see    But wait the subject is smirking  Okay Im confused  Well I thought the snow should have been whiter anyway
Wow looks like two photogs got together and just changed the subject on set Great lighting and set but when two people get together and cant come up with two different ideas lacks the creative bug Two pics of businessmen holding power tools Someone should have changed it up And I just noticed both titles have competition in them
Boy I hope he knows what he is getting into here did anybody give him pointers The silhouette is wonderful and the subject playful Nicely composed the colour contrast is great Beautiful shot
Definitely meets the challenge and exhibits proper bokeh  The subject matter leaves me wanting not because its a flower  I have nothing against flowers  it just lacks a wow factor for me  Good luck
Fascinating on sooo many levels There is just something about lightening that makes us as people want to stare Thus making it a great subject for pictures this one seems to do a cool dance about the sky also lol
My first impression is that you probably got some low votes on the whole is it a silhouette or is it a shadow debate Personally I did not vote silhouette images any differently that shadow images but I know some did
Processing is a bit harsh but the subject matter stands up to it more or less Priceless moment
My first impression is that this was very well thought out and that the hunched over peanut does a great job at expressing his emotions Choosing to have the foreground peanuts in focus and having the 3rd peanut out of focus really helps drive the message here The ample negative space also helps create the sense of being alone This photo fits very well into the theme and therefore I am not surprised it finished in the top 10 In comparison your original image I think this one is much stronger The other one was too dark and less sharp overall Great shot
Great subject and great shot
Like the subject and the comp  The extreme saturation of the water isnt enhancing it to my eye In fact because this has a timeless feel to it maybe this would look really cool bw if you get around to experimenting
Its a beautiful tree but as the subject of a nightscape its a little too up front  maybe if it was more over to the side and framing the background it would seem less obtrusive  the tonemapping didnt add to the overall picture in my opinion
Nice shot  It doesnt capture some of what I think is the best of Westons sense of form though there is more to his work I love it when he captures a subject with notable depth that is conspicuously flattened thus abstracted with his capture  I think your subject was too flat to start with to recreate that  With that in mind I think the contrast lighting framing and spirit of your shot are spot on  I really like it
Great macro of a spider and what looks like a leaf The subject is great and the lighting is even better how it reflects off the water I especially like the dimples created by the feet However the focus is a bit soft for my likings This is a small subject with great detail and should be shown as such But then again it could be my monitor 6
I like the concept put not the quality of the photo Its always better to deal with 640 px on the longer dimension it makes your photo more enjoyable I am not happy with the lighting the tones are not really nice and a lot of texture is lost I like though the composition Just an idea it would add a lot to your photo to include the subject of business or the environment into the background A blurred cityscape with skyscreapers or some computers as the product anything It would make your photo live 3
Great subject and compostion I particluarly like the words on the tape and the angles of the ropes Very Nice
I like it  Even blown out and the subject to dark I didnt nnotice that on first glance I noticed the shot you intended to get and really liked it
Whats clever though is that there is enough general visual interest that your eye wants to keep looking to give the pic the time needed to get that
Perfect choice of subject for a square crop
An image that demonstates the subject matter of the challenge in spectacular fashion with excellant DOF and color control Both a technical and artistic success that more than adequately meets the challenge subject in particular with the color shades A very worthy contender for top ten honors and a possible ribbon contender
Your picture is oof and the subject is cut off on the right side I think in this case it would of been better to center the subject so the subject would be in full view
My first impression of this photo was that the kid was still able to maintain sanity even in a hectic world  My nitpic would be that I would have Siggi not smiling  Maybe have a more relaxed look on their face  otherwise I think this shot fits the challenge well and is technically well done and has that visual appeal that viewers love
Interesting subject  well observed  perhaps the wall lacks a little interest but youve got a good eye
from the guy that posted the other pic of a golf ball for this contest I have to say I like yours better  Nice natural setting Im used to finding erlooking for my golf balls in the higher grasses  I like the very crips subject and background in this pic too nice wide DOF with most of it in focus  nice pic
Although the subject is not all that attractive this is an amazing photo where everything works here extremely well  The longer I look at it the more it grows on me  Came back to comment and bump it up
Chilling managed to pick a subject that will always produce a strong reaction  The use of sepia works well to make it seem like a memory 9
Very nice PP on this to isolate the subject but keep the backdrop integral  Great job
I didnt vote on this challenge so this is the first time Ive looked at your image critically  I think your score is result of a combination of two things your subject choice and a couple of technical issues  One commenter mentioned that toys dont do well in DPC challenges  Im not experienced enough in the DPC ways to confirm that but a toy soldier as the main subject when fire is the assigned subject is not the way to garner high scores  Compositionally you did a nice job of setting this shot up  The soldier is located in a good location and all of the pieces fit together well  On a technical level there are things that could be improved  You made the right choice on using fill flash to help bring out the details in the soldier  Unfortunately the soldier doesnt have a lot of detail to begin with and the fill flash was just a bit strong causing harsh reflections and strong shadows  If you could have used a couple of light sources from the side preferably as reflected light the soldier might have come off looking a bit more 3 dimensional  I hope you find something within this critique helpful and feel free to PM me if you have any questions
The obvious subject means to me that you need to come up with a really creative composition to make this work well  Overall I find it rather boring  4
very interesting pic  you cover a tremendous amount of ground in it between fore middle and back  unfortunately they each feel very distinct to me and it doesnt feel like it meets a leading line challenge as your subject to my eye is the big building in the middle ground  nonetheless i really like your choice of toning
The subject is too far to the right for my liking but very sharp and nice colours
As for the subject you chose for this challenge it definitely meets the challenge requirements but is rather average by DPC standards  You will find as you progress with your photographic skills that your scores will increase  But it will be extremely hard to receive scores in the 6s unless you chose subjects that are creative as well as meet the challenge
So interesting I dont like that the ball which is the subject of the picture is so small This idea might have worked out better with a different setup and composition
The image could be a little more dramatic Its composed well enough and the subject is clear and detailed but its not close enough to really impact the viewer and the DOF is too detailed to allow the subject to jump out at you If the author intended to use the background as a texture a little different angle would have been a better choice Alternatively  little more focus would have helped this image score higher A good solid entry into the challenge
I do see the thirds that you might think would follow the rule of thirds but the main subject is not in a rule of thirds position because he is too close to the edge of the frame  The use of thirds does not lead you toward the main subject the person
Technically good but subject matter uninteresting
The Hard Rock subject doent go with the Soft pink highkey style
Not too bad but the strings are distracting from the part of the subject that are in focus
love your subject and composition beautiful capture of light on the bridge and foreground against the foreboding sky
This is one of the best shots that jumped out at me when scanning through the thumbnails  I love the silhouette here and the fact that your subject is doing something rather than just sitting there looking at the camera  I love the full wingspan and the dof Im not sure what else I can say about this shot it should be a ribbon winner in my opinion
Good subject material for this and well done overall  Good luck in the challenge
well captured shot BW certainly suits subject
This is very cool  Id give a bonus point if it were less grainy given the subject matter  For me this colorful subject needs to be REALLY sharp  Great choice on the background really good composition  Bottom line  7 maybe nudge to 8 later  Well done
technically well done and very interesting subject
A great subject for a North American like me  something Ive never seen in real life And while I think the BW aspect works the overall tone is just a bit too dark for me
I like the off centering of the subject and the repeating pattern of the louvered shutters
Oooh I have one of these in my front yard    They lend themselves quite well to odd perspectives dont they   I like the nice tones here as well as how you have balanced the subject against the sky
Pretty shot but I dont consider the subject to be that small
I like your choice of subject matter for this entry and your choice of postprocessing in BW  The faceplates on the wall next to the subject are a bit distracting but not sure how you could get around them  Maybe since it was advanced editing they could have been removed as a distracting element
Clean image but my eyes wander trying to find a clear cut subject matter
This is interesting and familiar looking  In my opinion the processing is way too heavy handed  She is so pretty that with slightly less contrast and saturation or whatever is making her look so orange it would be much nicer  Her eyes look great and the general idea comp clarity and all that good stuff is very nice indeed
the subject of this shot is clearly the flowers so in that respect I dont feel like this fits the challenge very well but thats just my opinion You still have scissors in the shot which technically makes it fit I guess I think this would be a decent shot more closely cropped and without the scissors which would make it unsuitable for the challengeIm just talking in general as is though a 6
Cool subject and colours  must have been difficult to get this shot unless its in a tank I would have gone for a wider crop to get more of the crab in
A portrait is a painting photograph sculpture or other artistic representation of a person in which the face and its expression is predominant The intent is to display the likeness personality and even the mood of the person For this reason in photography a portrait is generally not a snapshot but a composed image of a person in a still position A portrait often shows a person looking directly at the painter or photographer in order to most successfully engage the subject with the viewer
Interesting subject for the challenge  A bit on the plain side with it centered though
Its a popular stock subject choice Background looks good Not sure about the floating in mid air but as an isolated subject it works well
Im lost  Is the seagull the subject or are the people wearing the glasses
Sell chosen subject that you have composed nicely  The sky is perfect for the wind turbines isnt it
Nice image but this subject isnt saying beauty very loudly to me 5
A very creative look at colored pencils  the image meets the subject matter and with a certain cheeky attitude A terrific demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge Should be a sure bet to win a ribbon or place high as a top twenty image  A couple of minor detail problems not worth mentioning because they dont appear until you really get a critical eye and examine the image closely  Well done
I like the texture created here I do wish that the top were cropped a little to get rid of the white area I just think it would highlight the subject better
I think youll get penalised because the subject is not a light source in the traditional sense
Interesting choice of subject I have to wonder if you are getting low votes due to the most standout subject material is the closest
I would have prefered a more unusual angle this seems to be a bit too snapshotish  Great subject and play on the topic
The author might have done better to concentrate on one of the rabbits to get the maximum effect with respect to the subject challenge A little less lighting would have helped also A good entry into the challenge
subject is great and original
Yikes  But makes a good subject for an image    I like your composition and choice of negative space it works well here  Just enough to look at but not overwhelming with too much candy  Nice job  Good luck
A very creative look at crayons  the image meets the subject matter dead on with subtle yet detailed effect A terrific demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge the use of grayscale and color is outstanding Should be a sure bet to win a ribbon or place high as a top twenty image  A couple of minor detail problems not worth mentioning because they dont appear until you really get a critical eye and examine the image closely  Well done
nice color great light nice texture bw good nice lines however there is another pix in this challenge that has trees that shows the collection aspect of this challenge Im sorry to say I dont get that impression with this pix It looks like you opened the back door to your house and took a quick snap shot of the fist thing you saw
I cant tell what this is enough to actually perceive a mood  It looks like a marzipan or clay creature with a silly look on its face  I think the problem is youve chosen a subject thats far out enough that people are unable to evaluate it properly
Nicely done very crisp a little disquieting in the subject matter with these blank faces on a blank wall I like the choice of having one with its back to us Good luck
I like the sharpness of the subject with the blurred background
Well composed photo but the main subject might be sharper and more saturated The bright yellow colour in the background distracts IMO
Love the subject and how youve caught it at dawn Among my favorites this challenge
Wow  Your subject must have been sitting incredibly still to be that sharp with that long of an exposure  Very nicely done
Need to improve on sharpness  DOF on the subject that you would like to emphasize
Lovely leading lines  Maybe just a touch too contrasty  Too bad your subject isnt the strong point of the shot per the challenge directive
Although the subject is clearly the leaf and generally filling the frame and minimizing the other things is good I sort of like the other things youve included here
Great texture and interesting subject and crop
Dont understand the picture  Dont know what the subject is Nice textures though
You did a nice job of placing the statue according to the challenge description however the subject choosen has little appeal emotionally or visually  Plus Im not sure if converting this to sepia really works for this image as it tends to make the statue blend into the background in spite of the good contrast on the statue itself
Works well and a geometric shot Not the most interesting subject though
Well done The floating subject adds to the dynamics and the mystery of this technology Hope youll tell us how you did it
Interesting concept and very good framing I would have personally avoided the monochromatic tone In a case like this in my style I would have made the red layer and then erased a part of the subjects clothing Bumping up to 7 not because the image is surreal but rather a nice study because of the subject matter
Interesting idea however I feel the effect does not work for me My initioal impression was of a splodge blocking your lower face and having revisited a few times This impression remains
First impression
Theres a sympathetic if understated humanism here even without explicit human activity Just a turkey after all  normally the subject of sarcasm by us higher forms but here not so This image could be a classic and certainly a favorite of mine
I dont understand your title The subject is an obvious Y but a little on the boring side
Pretty scenery  Nice subject matter
Subject missing or not main subject 9
the subject seems to have a lot of potential but its lacking any definable form even with the title to give some hint I really dont know what Im looking at itd be interesting to see this from another perspective
If not for the title I would have never figured out what your intended subject was
If I run off the end can I fly Boring subject presented in an interesting way  POV excellent composition well done same for color and lighting  Evokes an emotion see first sentence 7 but will give a second pass
Beautiful DOF  I never appreciated flies until I joined DPC A bit of an overdone subject at this point but worthy of a high score 7
Great shadows and subject
At first glance the impression was of catacombs and given the title it still could apply A very nice conversion and there is nothing wrong with it from a technical standpoint From an artistic standpoint it lacks in impact even though there is plenty to look at it just seems like its all the same A suggestion might be to have taken this from a different angle and using bokeh to create a sense of depth and dimension which is lacking
This could of been a great photo but I find you subject a little dark I would of liked to see it stand out more Some may not even know what what the subject is because of the lack of detail Still a good shot
If ever a subject needed a back light
Wonderful blur and keeping the subject clear
Warm hat glowing sunshine which at least gives the impression of warmth beautiful portrait beautiful background One of my ribbon choices
Good subject and framing for the topic Anything musical gets my attention
Im not sure what the subject of this photo is supposed to be
The flash shadow is very distracting If you put more distance between the subject and the background it will help a great deal Interesting picture
Good attempt  I think this subject is really hard to photograph well  None of the needle and thread images in this challenge worked for me  This one is either too noisy or has a texture applied that I dont care for  The lighting is good focus could be sharper  Im still giving you a 6 for a good effort
It looks like your subject is quite the artist assuming she painted the cotton picture  Probably okay shot for a brochure though fairly flat flash lighting and cluttered frame are real problems
This is one of the shots I really dont think meet the challenge I dont say dnmc too often at all and have a really big tolerance for what I might see as my own lack of vision but even considering that I dont see the neg space here Wait I get it the sunglasses are the subject and so everything else is what you consider neg space because its all white Okay I get it Im afraid your going to be hurt on your score by others who dont look long enough to see it though
Ok so I guess congrats on the brown Well to be fair I dont think you should have done last place Although I can see why it was voted poorly The image is in my opinion softened far to much You cant see any natural beauty in the girl as its all masked behind your softening It is also done very blotchy on her skin which isnt very appealing compositionaly I think you could have pulled in one of the top corners to take the subject off center I think it may have helped a lot if you shot down onto the model which would give more definition to the subjects jaw and face the sharpness is nice on the eye though It would be nice to let the picture stand on its own instead of editing it so much Personally Im not a huge fan of the pose the knee is distracting and in the way I find myself mentally trying to look around it My advice is try and take full advantage of the incredible gear you have and the sharpness it can give
This just doesnt work for me  A photo of a subject holding the ruined broom and emoting exhaustiveness would have been much more connected to the challenge  This just seems a little hurried and shoehorned
Nice subject matter with interesting details  The image is framed well too  If I have one criticism I would say that the tone of the image is rather flat  I think its a white balance issue leaving the snow gray rather than white because your cameras sensor is trying to find middle gray  If that were corrected I think the snow would have been white and the orange part of the split pods would have popped no pun intended and given you a very high scoring image
almost as if it tilts But I love the subject and picture
Take a picture of a colored subject or subjects on the same color background
Back to comment and to bump to an 8  Wonderful job of highlighting a subject so well camouflaged
Im not sure valves is an accurate title but good subject anyway 6
The 115th vote in the series and the only ten so far Excellent portrayal of heat The subject has an exhausted sweaty appearance The reflection and hoop add a lot of interest and helps frame the subject Excellent work
I like the way it almost seems like a Renaissance statue with the male subject having impossibly big hands and a small head with a slightly weak chin and curly hair reminiscnet of the boyishness of David
First impression  I tried to scroll up to see the rest of the photo Nutty perhaps but from there stems my comment about composition  I just expected to have more on the top
The darkness of the subject is a worry for me  A lighter sky would be less of a problem to let me see the  metal better
I think your photo subject exudes personality  Perhaps the photo exposure quality is not great but you make up for it with a good subject 7
Thats odd  Surreal subject aptly and surreally blue  A lot of sky I like that and it fits the challenge nicely  I like this shot very different  Congratulations
the subject isnt occupying a very small portion of the image space
Your subject would stand out better were he in the sun Nice scene
amazingi love everything about this  great subject and composition
Your sensor was in competition with the subject for who would produce the most interesting grain It actually has a feeling of a found still life rather than a fossil at home Well done
Well done shot  The mood perfectly fits the subject matter  I would consider experimenting with some slightly tighter crops but it may end up being just different and not necessarily better
I like the use of what seems to be a dark sepia filter to add to the sense of an old photo the tree is a great subject and both setting and light are pleasingly eerie and emotive
There isnt really anything in this picture to keep me looking for more than a couple of seconds  Unfortunately the subject isnt very strong and I would have not noticed it without the title  For me there is no real center of interest in this photo and that is the main thing that is keeping it from being a great photo
An image that demonstates the subject matter of the challenge in spectacular fashion with excellant DOF and color control Both a technical and artistic success that more than adequately meets the challenge subject in particular with the color shades and the whites being right on the edge of overdone A very worthy contender for top ten honors
The subject you chose figurinne rarely does well on DPChallenge as people see shots of them as copouts Its a good attempt but with some major flaws Good luck in future challenges
Wow This one really makes you look twice hehe Wonderful subject perfectly photographed Yep from the look in her eyes she is someone you wouldnt want to mess with Excellent
The subject has to much space at the back in my opinion
Nice bokeh but the subject isnt as sharp as it should be
Impressive Cambodia I am a bit divided about this image In order to find this moving I need to think of myself walking surrounded by this amazing architecture and surroundings in the silence stopping by to examine the countless statues and details to look at the looming trees and shade my face from the sun spearing them To stop and reflect on how long silence came quietly living there filling everything The image evokes all of this with a certain effort on my part and the help of countless documentaries and my very own memories Perhaps not a defect of the image but of the subject matter Very good job in the BW processing and framing
Unique viewpoint which can imparts a sense of vertigo An image that demonstates the subject matter of the challenge in good fashion with excellant DOF and color control Both a technical and artistic success that more than adequately meets the challenge subject in particular with the color shading
The metal cross is overwhelmed by the hands  It reduces its subject strength   I wonder how the picture would have worked if you gloved the hands and focused more strongly on the cross
i like it but I feel there is a subject there
The original made such an impression on me So happy to relive the experience 
i think the subject is a bit small and lost
nicely captured  wish the subject was a little sharper though  with all the brown in the water and background this might have been a good candidate for a bw conversion
IMO ya stretched the subject a bit too much
I think the green on the wall draws the attention away from what the subject should be the painter in the light suit Although it is a farely light shade of green so I am not voting you down for that just thought I should state my opinion
Really They look sharpened already and do not convey the subject to me I like the photo itself but
Its a Harley allright but the guy on it does not look comfortable or easy at all great dof takes attention away from the main subject
Image seems very onetone  Missing some drama like some good shadows  Nice creative subject though
Stuff thats not really working for me There is just too much of our main subject IMHO My eye keeps dancing around the entire frame with no central subject to focus on Perhaps focusing on just one branch would help you our here with the composition
A little over processed for me Would have liked to see this in just black and white with the natural light Nice subject tho
This may have worked better with a watercolor filter applied to the whole image As it is the main subject which draws the eye is OOF and the other two flowers are oversharpened and the tree in the BG is distracting Great colors here but another way of prcessing the shot may have worked better
What an incredible sky  I love the contrast between the clouds the ocean and the sand  Wonderful subject choice  I love this shot
This looks like a fun subject but the entry is too small
Challenge requirements  this is where I feel it fell short  The words above the statue are from French Legion and actually mean Honor and Fatherland  This is a total disconnect from the mood and lyric of the song The song is indicative of someone going it alone without the helpcompanionship of another after the breakup of a relationship and the photo indicates something of honor or patriotism in times of battle  It may have come across stronger without the words in the shot  Then it would be a solitary person with no outside reference to influence the voters  The one element of the lyric that is represented well here is individual strength  But I dont think most voters will go that farthey will take it on first impression from a very short look
Not bad interestingly lit Slightly blurred though and could have chosen a more interesting subject perhaps
Its a good capture and well lit but the subject just doesnt interest me in anyway
I do not understand what is surreal about this Lighting couldve been better especially on the subject Composition is weak and it leads away from the main subject of the shot Not enought sharpness there is a wierd fuzyness everywhere which is not very appealing 4
The subject is rather dark and cut off  Including the entire toy and using fill flash would have helped overall quality  Also the door in the bg is distracting
Nice DOF focues and colors All are very appealing making this simple subject photo interesting I like the lines as they lead me across the image
An excellent subject with lovely undulating lines  I like the patches of light interspersed with the shadow  The shadow area does have a bluish cast that seems a little off to me  Still one of my top picks  9  Voted earlier
Great subject and nice composition but the partial desaturation makes this look a little weird 5
I dont understand how this relates to a subject that generally refers to animal life This photograph doesnt make sense to me at all
Unless you are in the southern hemisphere youve GOT to be freezing right now This has very good light texture and subject but I feel that the center was not the place to go facing away and to an angle that cut across the might have created an atmosphere of departure You facing the camera gives the impression of a return from adventures already had and the straight angle removes any possibility of motion
Other than the frame Artistic value is very good  Your subject is clear and lighting looks good
Wonderful bird  Youve stopped the motion just fine  The image overall feels quite flat like you need some additional contrast  The subject is also on the soft side a little sharpening would probably really make this eagle stand out  Good luck in the challenge
Great photo Love the colors the sharpness is right on as well I also really like the subject shirt color as it is such a contrast to everything else in the pic I wish I could shoot photos like this
The mountain on its own is quite dramatic but whats missing here is another subject to balance out this compostition
i like this image a lot but i would have possibly made the lighthouses andor harbor entrance a bit larger subject in the photo but of course not to take away from the ocean
This photo is beautiful As a musician myself I especially appreciate pictures of women with guitars So in all honesty your high score from me is slightly due to the subject matter But all around its an excellent entry
I really like the crop and the buildings give me a impression that they are the only things in world because of the black spaces com the water and sky Woa i hope this doesnt sound too crazy
Background offers too many details and draws the attention from the subject IMO Nice try and good luck
Nice job of a good macro subject for this image  Lighting is really excellent too
I like this image I like having to find the subject of the person resting on the sidewalk seemingly lost in the environment The patterns of the store grates and walk and all things manmade contrast nicely with the human form Even the texture of the tree trunk in its planter seems fabricated and unnatural
Nice shotreally awesome lighting  I would really have liked to see you tighten up on your subject a little more though  In trying to give the shot context the model has lost a lot of impact in the shot
Good subject matter needs better focus and at a left angle for lighting But a great shot
This is a great city shot but to be honest I rated it low  I looked it over for about 30 seconds and I couldnt find a subject that fit with Larsons style I like how you made the caption Ironic and I think that helps but its lacking cows chickens and dinosaurs if you know what I mean
certainly this meets the challenge subject wise a good find the light  from some spots looks overexposed and some detail seems to be lost but the graffiti adds alot of interest all in all a pretty cool shot
A week early for the macro challenge but this is very nice and the lines lead one to the insects perching point without detracting from the actual subject
The best photo of diamonds in the challenge  Great concept my only suggestion is that the chocolate kiss doesnt look like chocolate and is rather un appealing  The rings are the subject of the photo and are displayed in a way that makes me want to buy them
Niced photo of a giant eyeball or UFO interior or whatever it is  How do the rods or cables fade into nothingness in the centre  Anyway its not a subject Id choose but it certainly eyecatching sorry couldnt resist that  It has got a somethings missing feel about it though  6
Interesting subject in a potentially interesting location  Good job with focusing on the details Point of view could have been better IMO
Good idea the strange speckling kind of destracts from your subject however
I look at this image and think how so many will say there is no link to this challenge but cannot help myeslf to be influenced by the expression that this rhino seemingly has on his face  The lips seem pursed in wonder the eyes squinted with worry lines above and below the stance is reticent  Were this a human subject with an expression like this one would be forced to agree that the person was deep in thought potentially making a hard decision  For the expression alone then I grant a solid link to the challenge request
Great choice of subject for this challenge The colors are out of this world somehow which makes it even more interesting Less of the top boardwalk might have worked better crop a bit
Great photo  Ill bet he was a very interesting subject to take pictures of 
This I like  Great building what character and a perfect subject for black and white  Maybe its me though it looks a little unhorizontal
Harsh flashlight never seems to look good Moving your subject away from the wall helps as do diffusers Personally I just try to avoid using a flash if I can help it at all
i do see your intent here but this face doesnt say beauty to me that not to say males cant be the face of beauty but if you choose a male subject think youd be better served focusing on physique and form over a portrait
Great use of bokeh to show distance  Just wish the subject popped more  Maybe by increasing saturation
you clearly failed to see all the leading  lines that by leading towards her emphasize the brunette as the main subject of the composition
Nice capture of the lightning strike  I love this image but not sure that it is really about concrete  Yes I realize that there is plenty of the stuff in the image but the main subject is really lightning  That being said I still think this is an excellent image and kudos to you for being out in the storm  An 8 from me
Certainly no subject herenot one of my favs but certainly a 9
great contrasts and subject
I like this subject and compositon  The light seems to be a bit too harsh
Personally with this photo I think the contrast is just fine and added to the appeal of the HCB challenge Your black point is in a good place when looking at the shadows and his shoes you can see detail in his jeans and the whites oh his shirt have some detail in the creases etc I think much more contrast would have brought out elements in the brick such as the patch job to his left that would have been a bit of distraction As is your subject popped from the background and there is certainly still enough detail in the buildingwall behind him to make it pleasing It helps make it more of a period shot in my opinion Congrats
Photo small and OOF Not a very interesting subject Street light should have been cropped out
Use the surrounding space of your subject to create the wow of the photograph
I want to know what hes looking at Im left completely unsatisfied from this image what is he looking at Why is he there He is NOT a typical sbux customer Looks like hes headed to the moon after he finishes checking his GMail I cant even be bothered by the imperfections in this image  the deal on the bottom left the fact that everything in the image excepting the subject is arranged just perfectly etc  because the subject is that fascinating Amazing capture  twice in a lifetime
Photo matches the title and the subject really well  Personally would have like the female subject to be more out of focus
Excellent subject matter characters and composition  Good luck
interesting subject and meets the challenge focus could be better tho
ouchthe processing really kills this in my opinion Its really too harsh given the subject matter
The bus is an interesting subject but theres too much nonessential information around it A closer crop might have worked better
I think that the title along with your photo is an artistic statement on the state of manhood and on being a modern husband in the western world In our modern female dominated culture manhood has been kicked to the back of the bus and dont dare speak your mind about the subject or risk being labeled a wussy who cant take it or just the opposite a woman hating oppressor All in all manliness is missing from our culture today
Great DOF or lack of Could perhaps crop more to emphasize the subject bud at the expense of the one in the background
dont know exactly what your subject isthe round cylinder isnt that interesting to methe city beyond has more appeal
Your subject looks a little washed out to me and she doesnt look like shes napping but just happened to blink during the shot
very cool illusion like subject to photograph
Yes BW works better I was under the impression the the colors were red and white i dont know why If it were than color would work too It would work also with the Polska Dot 
Somethings out of whack Not sure where you went wrong with the processing but the subject is nice and the composition is very good too
nice concept and general composition altho a a lower fstop if it was available to isolate girl from background via DOF would have improved shot IMO
Certainly an interesting subject for this challenge
this is great the subject is so clear  very important and whatever this is  its very clean haha i really like the circle in the middle being part of a larger circle great color
Im with the others on this one I love the negative space too it gives a nice impression of the freedom I have always felt that birds have
I dont know what the subject is here it is in focus color is balanced
There doesnt seem to be any subject or focal point to give this photo strength
It has a nice feel to it though the wall behind the subject is just a little too distracting The soft focus on the subject works well but not with the sharp wall Focusing slightly in front of the subject may have been better or slightly behind with a large aperture for a small depth of field
A nice job on producing the silhouette effect  The sky has some nice coloration and detail  The positioning of the subject is not the most effective for this challenge  This pose looks like awkard and does not convey a peaceful look
good choice of subject but the focus is far too soft
quite exotic looking like the sun hanging out on the power line your a bit dark on it and the subject is vertually disappearing
I think this is well done but its not very interesting for me  Somehow it doesnt feel abstract enough for me to find it simply visually interesting but nor is it a concrete subject that holds interest  Perhaps a stranger angle or more of the lights  I like the color and the softness of the lights however
Nice idea  However technically suffering quite a lot  Reflections in glass are very distracting get closer to glass consider polarising filter  subject is out of focus and wires in background distractframe on LHS adds nothing and should be cropped out
A little blurry and needs work on the composition  There is no real central subject here so it ends up feeling jumbled and disorganized
nice color and mood  Perhas the subject is a little too close to the edge for my taste  But that is just me
Not sure the subject really holds my interest
Cool shot at first glance I wasnt sure if I was looking at a candle or an apple the subject is very balanced
Maybe not the most interesting subject for a free study
Well lit beautiful subject matter nice soft background Ill bet this is a top 10 8
Nice work with the subject matter Nice composition The focus problem is all that is keeping this from being an excellent photo
My first impression was a Venus Flytrap  But I really have no idea  Nice
Its an impressive macro especially considering the subject is yourself but I have to say the closeup details of an eyeball really freak me out with all the little blood vessels and things Aesthetically such detail makes me not want to view the image again
Nice effect  Turning your subject inside out
Really really neatthough perhaps if the subject was a little closer and larger it would make a better picture
A very creative look at crayons  the image meets the subject matter dead on with subtle yet detailed effect A terrific demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge in a very unusual way Should be a sure bet to win a ribbon or place high as a top twenty image  A couple of minor detail problems not worth mentioning because they dont appear until you really get a critical eye and examine the image closely  Well done
A little dark  Otherwise a good subject and ocmposition
Dogs and fire places are a natural candid subject as they both fit together like honey and fresh bread In this case the image doesnt work due to under exposure of the subject and the over exposure of the fire in the fire place A little more time composing this image would have helped significantly
Focus is a little soft on the subject and it is a bit dark but decent bokeh and lovely sky
A really good choice of subject and I like the contrast if colours
The subject really pops out of the frame Was this fillflash on its own or something like two separate RAW develops Either way or any other way indeed I like the effect
Ugh Looks like mathematics which is not the usual subject of correspondence upon stationery Please dont send any my way A better use of the elements would do more justice to the challenge
Hey wait a minute those arent monkies  I love th ecolors in this however I sort of feel that because of the composition the bridge is being presented as teh subject rather than the people  perhaps a lower angle and maybe getting cloer to the subject wouldve worked though the latter was probably impossible because of the water  I do like how the bridge is framed and I like the mountainshills in the background  Maybe even if youdve panned lower to include more of the water in the foreground thus moving the bridge to the top and focusing on the pair but I dunno  Nevertheless a good shot
Very sharp photo but the subject doesnt stand out enough for me 6
good choice of not setting the subject right smack in the middle for this isnt a very strong subject in the first place
The idea is OK but with such an steady subject at least get it in focus and in frame
Excellent cube design and leading lines The touch of the natural elements adds subject contrast 8
There is no conflict and disruption here but acceptance and a sense of general harmony
The highlighted hair on the girl and horse gives the impression of oneness between horse and girl
Interesting shot  The blue eyes really make this photo pop  The subject must have had fun putting on and taking off the red paint7
Sorry but I dont see this flower as being pink so even though it is a superb image it doesnt really match the subject requirements
How many years have these fellows been at a standstill They make for a great subject matter for this competion
Unusual subject for the challengealways a good thing
I think the very strongest thing about this one is your use of leading lines All lines lead to the subject there is no question in the viewers mind as to what the subject is  Your macro details are very sharp the focus is perfect
This is an excellent subject  it is a bit noisy and might have benefitted from a shorter exposure
Im seeing ROT but having a hell of a time with what the subject is If the green thing was placed a bit lower in the frame and I could tell what this is I would have a better feel about this 6
Great subject and excellent PP Im going to have to get PP lessons from you I love the mood of this shot It makes me want to be there
very unusal composition I understand the main subject here is the san grass and lighting in the front
the main subject of this photo  the front rock  is quiet blown out and seems to be over sharepened
The grain works really well Really adds to the texure in the subject matter itself
but the subject isnt supposed to be the faceso unless you were going for an extreme expression of the ear i think you overlooked the challenge P but cool idea 
Color and general image technical quality is good The setting is nice and hiding your main subject behind out of focus leaves works for this composition
With all that jumble of horses I dont get much sense of subject or motion  I realize this wasnt a motion challenge but Im just saying in general motion would have created more interest  It is a good capture of speed and energy though  Did you try motion panning with the horses Sometimes that will add motion although it can be tricky
sorry This isnt motion panning There is motion but motion panning involves tracking a moving subject with the result being a sharp subject and a blurred background
Subject missing or not main subject 9
Excellent treatment for subject  works perfectly together  If the toning were a little more antique I could actually imagine this being taken in the 1800s 9
I like this alot but I definitely wouldnt call this an image with no subject matter I would say masts is the major subject resonating throughtout this Nice lighting and color
I tended to score most of the pretty scenic shots pretty low this challenge But that is not the case for this one Even though they are but a small portion of the image they are definately the subject of the photo I like the way the smallest child is lifted into the aair This adds a bit of depth to your theme The colors and siloutte work are perfect Keep up the great work
You framed up the subject with the background but it just doesnt have much wow factor to the image  This was a tough challenge to meet the requirements AND have an interesting subject  Better luck in the future
I think a story could be told with the image but if the subject is the boy the focus should be there as well   I dont think the composition truly tells the story well either
not a great execution where is the main subject  a better compositional work can help
Im not finding myself terribly captivated by this image I think due to subject matter and the from above perspective isnt really dramatic enough of a shift to bring me into the scene The black and white helps but I think what I really want is to see the face of the person leading the boat and maybe a slower speed to show the motion I know itd be killed here by the other voters but it would be more true to the title
i like the subject but you should have try to get another angle to get the tree out of the bear butt 
ThanksI really enjoy shots like this where the horizon is purposefully not straight  Sometimes its a great way to fit a subject in that otherwise wont fit  I hope that you do wellI did my part and gave you a 8
Great imaginative photo  Super cute blue eyed subject
As for the main subject a thorn bush of some kind it is an interesting subject I think it was probably your intention and I think it works for moodiness but probably not for scoring but it is basically only black and white with no greys This makes it stand out from the background quite well but what it does not do is show you details on the bud is that what it is It looks like a spikey black ball with white streaks in it Again I personally think this works but I think the more common DPC voter appreciates detail and midtones more than cutout blacks and moodiness
ah wonderful intimacy is indeed the effect of crowding the subject into the corner a moving glimpse
The subject isnt very appealling but this has nothing to do with the quality of the shot Good idea going BW also
He looks mean Good composition The angle helps to give the impression of you dont want to mess with me
Your post processing is very original and emphasizes the subject the pills without being pretentious The composition is good with the angle of the hand the background telling more of the story and lastly the positioning of the pills themselves
A very creative look at colored pencils  the image meets the subject matter and with a certain cheeky attitude A terrific demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge Should be a sure bet to win a ribbon or place high as a top twenty image  A couple of minor detail problems not worth mentioning because they dont appear until you really get a critical eye and examine the image closely  Well done
This has potential with some post work perhaps bit busy beyond the window  Look at some work done with the same subject by Jeb   or Steve  
Meets challenge very well  take a photograph whose subject is enhanced by the bokeh of the background Nice life affirming Same subject better than my own entry  top ten
Ok Im lowballing this and here is why  Blue on Blue is what you present as your theme  Yet the dominant subject in the photo are the large red bars  Add to this the white railing or knee wall and the brown bit of concrete showing and this is about as far removed from color on color as could be
Great leading lines but what is it leading to I keep asking myself I feel like there is no definitive subject here Great execution I love the tones
Nice can really get an impression of the weight here
The greens look wrong to me and too oversaturated in general in my opinion
looks likes the subject was constructed
There is a delicacy of tone texture and subject matter and the quiet play of shadows not exactly classic DPC eyecandy but very pretty
The sky looks blown out If that is the case you might consider some BW conversion just my humble opinion In general the sky was against you that day 
There were a few of pictures of this subject and I think that this one was the most welldone
A classic subject and good capture of interesing reflections Wish the rock masses could have just a little more definite separation from background
Image seems overprocessed and the subject is not very compelling
Great clarity The reflection on the mesh and the red area behind combine to make this simple subject very appealing to the eye Well done
Very nice composition the grays of the subject contrast nicely with the warm colors of the background Beautiful light on the water and bridge
The text is not clear fom the subject and the picture would do better without it
The challenge said the bokeh should enhance the subject  not scare it  But anyway  a well done and thoughtprovoking image
Definitely meets the challenge and exhibits proper bokeh  The subject matter leaves me wanting not because its a flower  I have nothing against flowers  it just lacks a wow factor for me  Good luck
Gives the impression of something other worldly
The author has chosen a interesting subject and it almost works  very abstract and different A little more focus would have helped this image score higher with its combination of detail and blank space A good solid entry into the challenge
Great image and a good subject
Fantastic shot  Love the lone subject in the mist
The pink flowers are distracting from the subject of the photo  I would have cropped in tighter on the main subject the water bridge
Was your subject primarily illuminated by a nonstationary light
A very creative look at crayons  the image meets the subject matter dead on with subtle yet detailed effect A terrific demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge in a very unusual way Should be a sure bet to win a ribbon or place high as a top twenty image  A couple of minor detail problems not worth mentioning because they dont appear until you really get a critical eye and examine the image closely  Well done
Great vivid colors  The subject is very interesting
A lovely subject and the sky is very beautiful Its a little over processed for my taste
A good solid image that is properly framed and composed but suffers from a dark subject matter The author was looking for a dramatic impression which might have worked if there had been slightly more detail or if the subject had been framed by backlight A little more thought and composition would have produced a very effective image and one that would be memorable
If I may venture one advice you should avoid direct sunlight for a portrait Well I guess there are no rules but this one is a good place to start If you look at the pictures in this challenge youll see that the best ranked one where you can see similar direct sunlight spots on the subject is 49
This would be damn near perfect if the person was looking in this general direction
great texture and processing very interesting subject
And the winner is white Focused well subject draws the eyes right to the Dice Good shot
I love the subject matteer and the tones are top notch
I thought the tones you were able to capture especially in the lower left peppers was pretty good  Not the easiest subject to get really great contrast but you seemed to handle it pretty well  I ended up giving this one a 6 but I dont think I really looked all that closely at it when I scored it  That lack of color causes people to really bypass the black and whites unless there is a lot of contrast
Isnt this a vertical picture of a vertical subject that you rotated Not sure if that meets the challenge
Im not sure what this photo needs I am thinking more subject matter mabey the bottom is very distracting
I have stood here and photographed this river Its a splendid subject that would be better IMO if it were a little brighter in your photo
It is nice how the patches of subject and background merge together
Love the subject and the rock gave it a 5 Might have been a 7 or an 8 if the girl was sitting on the rock looking out or at least looked like she was there for the picture This looks like you wanted the picture of the rock and she was just in the way  It just takes that little bit away from the overall appeal
Hm I had something along the same lines myself but didnt upload it Compositionally this is very strong and there is a sense of atmosphere to the empty room I think youve done a good job wiith the balance of exposure in a near imposible situation without taking obvious processing artefacts to a noticeable amount The impression of haze around the window the unevenness of it bugs me just a little I like the idea of it but the nonregularity of it somehow makes it seem unsuited to the room unnatural almost out of place Unless of course that  a processing artefact 
Interesting subject and composition Your focus detail and textures are great
Over exposed  I like the subject matter It would have been nice if you could have tried different angles
one of the best pics ive seen on this site really impressive the name is actually 50 of the overall impression ive got from seeing it but still a good achievement
And the anthropology student thinks nothing other than the Laetoli mudflats LOL I like the concept and youve executed it well All the technical stuff is good but its the subject matter that gets me Look up Laetoli if youre not sure what I just babbled about P
Way to go Rikki We picked the same subject matter but you nailed it
What a great subject for this challenge Wherever did you find it
A good attempt however I do not feel that the plants are the subject in this photo Certainly an interesting perspective though
ps Having flare as the main subject while keeping it interesting is a unique achievement
terrific image I love the dramatic sky Great contrast in the subject with superb detail I really like the feeling of depth that this composition creates The edgy processing works really well with the subject too
The subject is minimalism This pic pretty much says it all Most of the others are unclear as to what they are trying to say This says minimalism
The rose is pretty but not in the right position  The moon is without detail to be the subject but its in the right spot Although a beautiful rose I dont think it works for this challenge
A lovely subject and I really like the framing of the building it meets the challenge well and is very beautiful One of my favourites
I like the subject but not the Lake in the background
I think this would be stronger if it was clearer  The subject looks softfuzzy while the wall looks crisp
IMO I think you should try with the pic again with a slightly different angle to make the subject even more interesting
Nice subject and textures I like that branchwhat an odd direction its going in I like the lines that the branches make Especially the whying branch How bizarre nature is sometimes eh Interesting subject and well captured Its nicely in focus Sharp And black and white suits this quite well and encourages texturingdefinitely suits the criteria of the challenge No question in my book
Focus seems a little soft here  the name is sharp The subject matter also does not excite too much for a FS 5
There needs to be a little more separation between the subject and the background in my opinion
I like it but the subject is too central
Fascinating subject and great execution Well done
I like the subject and idea but the execution isnt doing much for me Maybe having the kids hold hands or showing some other way of togetherness would have more impact
Not a huge fan of the smashing pumpkins myself but Im definitely a fan of this photo  More vanishing point than leading lines going towards a subject but Im not going to be overly picky  I love the rhthym of this shot and the tones are fantastic
Id pull the subject in from the corner a little more  lines lead too far
I get the idea however I dont see any texture or detail to the nail  It is to be the subject of the picture based on the exposure but most of it is just a black shape
i love this very natural the subject was precise cheers
I like the subject and composition but I think the background is a bit distracting  This might look good in with a black velvet background
Congrats for the 10th place  Marac  Although I did not voted  I was all the time with the impression that this should be the winner in this challenge
Its a  strong image  The bokeh is impactful but I think a little too much of the subject is out of focus  And I am bothered by the blown highlights though I imagine they are just about inevitable
Nice car I have always liked the moving people photos with a main subject sitting still And black and white works very well
In this image the eye mine at least is drawn to the building in the upper lefthand corner The actual framed subject is small and just doesnt stick out enough
I have achieved it with consistent and wonderful results depending on subject matter of course I could have done some slight processing in photoshop to reduce the whiter area in the middle but i wanted to display it as it was shot
I have questions for you to ponder what is your subject for this photo
The short definition of Bokeh from KenRockwellcom which I am using for voting on this challenge Bokeh describes the rendition of outoffocus points of light Present  Is the subject enhanced by the bokeh of the background Yes A very nice image though on my monitor recently calibrated there is some artifacting on the left side where it goes to a darker gray Also the patterns in your points of light are somewhat distracting but thats not your fault 
Beautiful image Really gives the impression of cold congratulations on your 5th place finish Much better viewed at 500px
subject should not be in the middle
First off Im always drawn to BW images of flowers as they can at times surprisingly depict the inherent beauty of a subject that typically uses color as a primary component of attraction as this photo does It presents a strong first impression The dramatic contrast and abundant use of negative space really draws me in as a viewer The offcenter composition is effective as well and creates a powerful isolation of the subject  which is amplified by your choice of title The patterns and contrast of the cut glass create a combined balance and tension for me I like the mirroring of the flower with the radial pattern on the bottle directly below it although Im struggling a bit with splitting my attention between the two  not really sure where to focus
What can possibly classify it as motion Blur of slopping water at the boulders Its so timid that the first impression is actually one of stillness not movement
Well what is the main subject in this photo
A perfect title that compliments An image that demonstates the subject matter of the challenge in spectacular fashion with excellant DOF and color control Both a technical and artistic success that more than adequately meets the challenge subject in particular with the color shades A very worthy contender for top ten honors and a possible ribbon contender
wOw nice macro shot I love the simple but effective composition Very interesting subject and titleGreat DOF too
I like the pose but my suggestion would be to have the subject wear a color other than black It seems so much detail is lost its almost like hes a floating head
Perfectly emotive and a great impression of that time of day and weather  Very nice indeed  Understated 8
The tree is too subtle Im sorry  The reflection maybe the building is the hero and subject of this image  The trees seem kinda not the point
In this case I would have liked the subject closer to the water your colors are good
fits the subject well
I truley like this image I just think having the subject dab smack in the middle of the frame is too much in your face Rule of thirds should of been observed imo
Nicely done I like the subject and the processing Very Currier  Ives
Nice way to catch the flower twice Excellent clarity of the subject and the background
Nice bokeh Perhaps subject could have been a little lighter
Excellent subject for this challenge and you did a great job capturing the lines and depth as well as with the processing Very nice
Great subject for this assignment
Effective subject placement
Image is a bit small but interesting  Main subject a bit out of focus  Nice comp tho
This looks like someone I know though its not  The blue of the eye is a bit artificial but it is striking and fits with the general heavilyprocessed look  More processing than I would use personally but it is well done
Interesting subject matter I estimate 54
i love the softness of the mist and the very faint hints of color  the subject is perfectly placed
I have the impression that there is too much sharpening used Great theme
The tilted horizon and the bland subject dont do much for me Maybe taking a different angle on the hat would help 4
nice subject and interesting shadows although i think the tree in the foreground is a little distracting
i like the choice of subject  lots of intricate shapes and textures in a small space  the lighting on the right seems a wee bit too much
I like how the subject was in the shadows and not so much the actual subject
If the subject was sharp it would help this shot tremendously Great catch though
I think the cactuspalm is really unattractive  Without it the mountains would be the subject and theyre beautiful   But thats just one opinion out of many   not voting yet
Nice shot but the tracks are a bit distracting and take away from your subject title  A smooth snow cover would have added alot to this photo
Nice idea and effort but it seems just a tad too soft  this is the sort of subject you should feel the pain from the barbs just by looking at its sharpness good luck
First I would crop the bit of arm on the right side but then the subject would be too close to the edge 
Lines are leading away from the subject not towards it particularly with the shallow DoF
Very nicely done emulation on the original The main subject is illuminated wonderfully such that we can see many details and the pose of the subject with clarity My only critique here is that the tones seem a bit cold Now admittedly that does fit in with the mood you are trying to convey despair However on my monitor I am seeing some warm reddish brown tones in the floor Bringing out and turning up those tones to a more visible level could help the visual appeal because the warmer tones can add another dimension that would be interesting to the eye Also by playing around with BrightnessContrast Color Balance HighlightMidtoneShadow Adjustment and perhaps the Gamma Adjustment controls would bring out a more richer deeper tones to the wood of the Woody for as they appear now the tones are flat and cast in a cold light
Really great subject for the challenge and presented well Terrific focus on the eye and good detail captured where its needed The soft focus on the outside of the image as well as the vignette may have been added in post but its done well without being too heavy handed
I assume the  bricks are your subject or is it the cup or is it the house   Kind of an odd subject to me
Fits the challenge well subject plus technical but not a pleasing photograph visualy
My first impression was what is that 4  But then I stopped trying to make sense of it and just looked at the patterns of light dark and color and Im voting 6
I seem to have seen this before Still not my favourite subject 5
Okay Im starting to like this The tile and angle are effective and neither subject is fully visible for different reasons which gives it some mystery
not a very interesting subject
Rare to find your subject within your lens Beautiful colors on the fish Nice
Take a photo of something but only HALF of your subject can be visible in the photo
An interesting choice for meeting the subject challenge made by more than one author This particular example of subjet choice is somewhat better than the others but suffers from the same issues odd reflections and just over the edge whites Similar to the other images it appear to be just ever so slightly oversharpened A little more focus would have helped this image score higher A good solid entry into the challenge
This is sort of nice but I feel that the subject is vertical anyway and the loss of lower legs spoils the image a bit If they had been lost due to a  horizontal framing it might have been more justified
The clouds especially mid left are superb but the subject itself does not do an awful lot for me but you have managed to convey a feeling of wind here good luck
I realize there is a line in the sky but it does not come off as the subject matter The shadows are too dark  I would have liked to be able to pick up some detail at least along the edges of the trees The image itself seems rather flat  and uninteresting
Photo well taken but not sure on the subject
The subject just didnt resonate with me  Nice lines and reflection in the glass
hmmmmsorry but this just doesnt appeal to menothing technically wrong but the subject just doesnt do it
subject is ok composition is ok its technically good but i guess its missing that wow facor for me
crop closer to the subject to create interesting negative space
I like how you work on this picture and I love it but as minimalism the bird is probably to little but the picture in general is so good that one might not dwell too much on that issue
I already voted now back for comments I gave you a 10 on this shot Lovely colors crisp detail excellent subject and bokeh
The subject should be more prominent in your image Other then that its a good example of bokeh
wow what a fine subject to shoot
A little less effective than it could be From a technical perspective it works but the blank white space of the sky gives the impression of being flat and detracts from the images impact This might have worked better if the subject had been a little closer giving some important details that are missing The unfortunate fade of the subjects head into the sky is a flaw that is immediately noticable A really good idea that needed some thought and more composition time A good entry into the challenge
Im trying to comment on every photo in this challenge and really have nothing to say here Yes these are flowers but even in an urban environment you can find a more appealing subject IMO
Great photograph even if Im not a fan of the subject matter 
I feel that theres not really a subject here to grab the interest as both the cat and the fish look out of focus
too soft great subject
This could have better subject placement for the photo but you had the right idea more so than others
good choice of subject  nice colors too
A very creative look at crayons  the image meets the subject matter dead on with subtle yet detailed effect A terrific demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge in a very unusual way Should be a sure bet to win a ribbon or place high as a top twenty image  A couple of minor detail problems not worth mentioning because they dont appear until you really get a critical eye and examine the image closely  Well done
Finally I really like visual surprises so to me this would improve hugely if you cropped off most of whats to the right of the candy putting it in the lower right corner  Then as my eye scans trying to figure out where the subject is I find it wwaaayyy down there
Interesing subject for the title  not too sure how this fits
Ha  Very vintagy postcard looking image  Although it seemed to have missed most of the subject 
great subject and love the person and dog there to show the enormity of the rock formation but there seems to be a lack of focus losing detail throughout the image
Content 14 Is the subject compelling Does the choice of content match the challenge
Too dark Virtually half your photo is black with no detail Your main subject is difficult to see leaving nothing to draw your viewer in
oftshot subject but very good treatment
Not bad a little crowded with vessels unavoidable and the darkness of the main subject directs the eyes  A little too dark for me  Good DoF and soft light
This image has a subject but could use some sharpness I would suggest opening up the aperture to get a bit more DOF
Nice snapshot  I think it would be more effective to get closer to your subject or crop tighter  To tell you the truth picture seems flat and uninteresting 4
Overall a nice interactive moment The general exposure and saturation is really good but shutter speed a bit slow as the front foals head appears blurry as it walks away The rear hedge looks like the hand of man planted trimmed cut back from time to time What story am I being told here by NG A great experience to witness these beautiful deer up close but there needs to be something more polished to speak to me in the way NG has done for readers
Way too noisy and the subject looks rather out of focus
I assume this is some sort of catherine wheel type firework Anyway you have chosen a very suitable subject and handled it very well with your sufficeintly long exposure to display it in a very interesting way You have also wisely decided to include its reflection in the water thus making it more than doubly interesting because of the ripples on the waters surface it works very well indeed
I cant make out the subject of this picture
Im looking more for moods from the subject in the photo itself not in the mood the photographer is trying to get the viewer to feel   and to be honest a raging waterfall as a subject is one of the least tranquil things I can think of
IMO excellent interpretation of the subject
The image meets the subject matter dead on A sound demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge in a very unusual way A couple of minor detail problems as the image appears to be less than sharp The DOF could have been used more effectively A good solid entry into the challenge
Too much empty space  this empty space creates excessive contrast which prevents your subject from being more dramatically lit and colored I think this is an attempt to fit the rule of thirds in where it doesnt suit you
This is a WONDERFUL imageso oddethereal actually For me it has a somewhat abstract quality about it which is quite appealing in this case I like that the subject isnt in your face obviousthis is an image that demanded more of my attention When I first came upon this picture when I was voting I actually cocked my head to one side and moved closer to the screen and thought to myself  what is thiswhat do we have here I love itexcellent job very elegant
interesting take on the challenge enjoy the graphic composition dont think the toning suits your subject very well
I do often like mist shots but this one has a bit too much mist The rail isnt an interesting enough subject to really carry the image and the background is just lost in the mist
IMO this is a victim of split primary subject  the rocks in the foreground or the waterfalls To see what I mean look at the image with the top just above the top of the bottom water falls
This is a neat shot i like how you put the subject on the side of the image beause you can really see the city and the lights  I like how you can see the light feflecting on the water  Nice shot
Nice subject and lighting  I might have like to see this shot with the flower in the lower left corner  still good though
Nicely composed elements but the turn of hte head of the primay subject draws the focus awaf from the core of the shot
Very nice composition I like the colortones perfect levels Maybe the subject is a little to close to the wall 
Brute intimidation by an old lion Perfect subject to illustrate this quote  Great details in the fur
too soft the subject is not clearly in the spot
Motion panning involves tracking a moving subject with the result being a sharp subject and a blurred background
Always a nice subject for speedmotion blur
Nice processing  a most interesting subject  the textures  shades are very appealing
A very creative look at colored pencils  the image meets the subject matter dead on with subtle yet detailed effect A terrific demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge in a very unusual way Should be a sure bet to win a ribbon or place high as a top twenty image  A couple of minor detail problems not worth mentioning because they dont appear until you really get a critical eye and examine the image closely  Well done
I like this shotI really do I just believe in a portrait we should be able to tell who the subject is
Your subject and light are beautiful and there is a lot of drama present by the lighting  I agree with the posters who think the angle of the light could be changed a bit perhaps more on the face of the statue to enhance your shot  I also think that more light would have made the focus sharper on the face which also will help your votes
I gave this a 4 mainly cause the subject doesnt interest me frankly my first thougth when seeing this image is that its a photo of nothing really  Not trying to offend just wanted to explain how I see this particular photograph nothing more and technically its good well exposed and sharp in focus
Excellent subject matter and black and white just works here
Looking at this picture I cant decide what your subject was I believe its the ducks but the emphasis is on the fence which is much brighter and attracts all attention the ducks on the other hand are in shadow the heads not showing and no detail that I can see
 interesting subject
Sneaking a peak through the safety wall  I the idea   The wheelbarrow seems soft on focus and the subject doesnt really grab me too much  6
Really like the subject and use of reflection on this
nice contrast  snow is such a hard subject to photograph  well done
Quite a bit of noise which doesnt suit the subject or the mood
Leave it to Mother Nature to give us great subject matter  nice capture 8
The sunspots compete with the subject for my eyes attention
Meets the challenge and you can spell  but I dont find the subject holding my interest Focus and DOF are fine The single bright light on the right over powers the photo Multiple light sources might have helped some The angle of the shot from above could be improved by lowering the camera and shooting at a shallower angle
oh wow this is great bokeh I like the portrait subject too good lighting you got here
Hard to get sharp details on that shark kite The subject just does not jump out at me whether its the kite or the man and your horizon is slightly tilted to the left I dont know if the BW worked well here I wonder what it would of looked like in color  Wish you well in the challenge
well its cool that theres a rainbow there but the subject isnt really that interesting and the colors are very strange  I guess you did that on purpose or it actually looked kinda like that  Im not buying the martian story though not a believer p
love the composition way to take a nothing subject and turn it into something
This is a nice capture that is very well exposed Compositionally there doesnt seem to be any real subject to the scene What are you trying to show me about this landscape It seems to be all background with no real focal point You got a fairly rich color in the sky One thing that could have helped would be to use a polarizer It might have cleared up the murky water
nice subject placement  Good work
Neat  I like your subject for the challenge  It seems like a pretty original take while still capturing the Weston style in an obvious way  Well done
This is going to seem weird but my first impression on seeing this was movie hero tied up to columns and struggling to free himself
hard to see the subject for the harsh highlights  over exposed
normally i wouldnt care for a subject right in the middle but this one seems to work where the texture of the field is interesting in and of itself  It might be nice to be closer to the bird but then that wasnt the point of the challenge i guess
First impression   OUCH 
I think it could be a bit sharperdudes are not my favorite subject matter but I can ignore that and judge the photo Great use of the rule of thirds9
Lovely contrast between the silver bubbles and the salmon background with your subject appearing over and over on the drops and the background Very nice composition  Looking forward to seeing how you did this one Excellent
not a very compelling subject when compared to 500 other entries
The short definition of Bokeh from KenRockwellcom which I am using for voting on this challenge Bokeh describes the rendition of outoffocus points of light Is the subject enhanced by the bokeh of the background Yep Very nice
The subject is underexposed
Very creative use of a simple subject matter  shows a creative mind
One comment to some of the posts theres a fuzzy aspect on the green lightsmoke in the low right I think it was because of too much sharpness I sharpened it before the crop and resize and after resize I think this is why theres a bit of halo around the subject and the dot aspect of the low right smoke
Creepy But it does depict the subject and is an interesting photo
WOW effect and first impression 012  1
If your subject is the peeper on the fence maybe you could have the whole fenceup to the camera in focus and let the background blurr to bring attention to the subject I be some people dont even notice your subject
This image has a subject but could use some sharpness Thats the beauty of Macro Photography to me being able to see textures that ordinarily unnoticed
compositions a little weaktoo centered and the subject is partly obstructed
If your subject werent right in the middle of the photo I wouldve scored it higher
Doesnt really give the impression of frozen
Focus is soft couple with the lack of composition Is the subject the rope or hand might want to work on te composition to improve the impact Sorry mate
This given that I was the voting authority would have won Its absolutely stunning This is what photography is for telling a story isolating a subject and giving you an insight into the world of the subject Fav
As a general photograph I really liked this the lines crispness BW However I didnt feel that the leaves accentuated or isolated the buildings enough for the challenge
The challenge says the subject should be strong  I had to look to find the hiker
i wish there was better contrast on the subject
Nice  Good subject and use of negative space  Light is a bit harsh  7
Good subject but backgraound  and no tale of the bird4
Regarding the actual subject of the image  pictures of our children unless very well done rarely score well  it may be a great shot to you as you have a connection with the child and we all know that photos of our own kids are the best in the world Sadly other people dont have that connection with your subject and thus its sadly overlooked Thats probably why this shot scored badly  to most voters who spend no more than 4 or 5 seconds on a shot  this is a shot of your kid messing around shoehorned into the challenge  and they scored it as such
Good representation of the challenge The subject does include stripes but the photo is basically a representation of a 2 dimensional object filling the frame You did get light and shadow portrayed by draping the object over the edge of something however as a photo it is somewhat uninteresting due to its nature
Im not sure what your subject is  If its the players theyre a bit too far away  If the whole scene is your subject theres just not enough detail to hold my interest
Chevros are awesome cars Great choice of subject for the challenge  processing suits it well
The photo search seems to have failed again to find your title so I am left to rate a photo as is Your subject is nice looking eye color is right on clear and bright Your DOF seems a bit uneven I think setting the strength of the blur much lower around the eye and slowly increasing strength as you get closer to the camera would have helped a lot All in all I like the picture and give it a 8
I dont see the technology in this shot but thats just me I also just feel that the subject is a little to dark But the framing of the subject is nice
I think the subject matter has a lot of potential I think the composure fails to take advantage of the potential
Great subject and link to the challenge I have many photos of this pyramid proposed to my fiancee in front of it
Doesnt wow me but interesting looking subject and nice colors
Very good image for the title or vice versa Your editing is a little loose around the doorway but its a beautiful scene and an excellent comp Although some may tire of this technique the subject lends itself well to the process Should do well
This is a little bland across the board Its not a terribly interesting subject so I would have tried to liven it up a bitmaybe a different composition for starters
This is like a scene out of National Lampoons Christmas Vacation It would have been great for a challenge based on movie scenes or Winnebagos or RVs or Camping or something like that I think it is a marginal subject at best for a challenge based on stripes
A good subject and a decent composition but without a lot of contrast and color I think this would have been a lot better in a deep high contrast black  white
Still the subject was a good choice for this challenge
Interesting subject contrast Good DOF
well done  i like the juxtaposition in both subject and color
Great subject and clever way to meet the challenge In the first look I thought this was a shot of a tree on some hill Then after reading the title it all makes sense to me
Neat effect but it doesnt do enough to make the subject interesting to me  Good composition though and I like the border
blurry subject and blown out sky No way ansel adam sorry
Disturbing in a way that makes me not like this very much Comps good BW works Levels are good Focus is terific In short a great capture of a subject that troubles me
Your main subject should be colored against a desaturated background  I doubt those greeneries are your subject here It also does not help to have this not straighten
The photo is ok but the subject isnt capturing my imagination
I think you got a really nice subject here but the picture is so dark its hard to tell  Tweak your levels a bit
A lovely photo but I feel that the subject is more the woman than the letter unfortunately
A very creative look at crayons  the image meets the subject matter dead on with subtle yet detailed effect A terrific demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge in a very unusual way Should be a sure bet to win a ribbon or place high as a top twenty image  A couple of minor detail problems not worth mentioning because they dont appear until you really get a critical eye and examine the image closely  Another image that deserves consideration if there were a DPC Hall of Fame Well done
The subject being the dog this could have been taken closer to the door and still have been very effective  as it is the distance to the door and dog are ineffective in stimulating any kind of emotional response
I appreciate you subject mater but the true subject wouldve been better served by a macro treatment to truly show the grains of snow As is the stopped motion is but a minor character undiscernable
I like the cut out silhouette feel I think the subject is strong enough to sustain it 7
I hope this is a montagelol Great flames The subject is a little dark but I think it suits the setting
Excellent backdrop for your silhouetted subject  The subject is minimal in information yet there is still enough there to tell the story  Very nice
First impression
Nice subject for an abstract Good lighting and composition however it looks soft to me like the lowlight focus could be improved To make this a nice photo to me the edges of your triangle must be sharp
Very good subject composition  Its tough workin with animals
not enough negative space perhaps if there was one subject instead of 3 it would work
subject doesnt seem to be the grains but the flowers instead
Thought this looked like your style and subject matter I was going to leave a guess but was not certain enough of it I like the play of light on the metal and the details are pleasing Got a 7 from me
My first impression is very positive  I dont usually like high key photos but this one is very well done  A lot of people seem to over expose their photos and call it high key  I am glad you did not do this
I could not really what the subject is A wall or building remains My wife made the same comment about some of my shots
Compositionally this is actually working quite well  However I think that the subject is just rather bland
Im having trouble beliving this didnt do better it was the only one in the challenge that I scored 10 I thought met the subject perfectly the composition is excellent and elegant in its simplicity and the technical aspects were well executed especially given the difficult extremes of contrast in the image I thought you should have ribboned Oh well
I like the subject and composition of this
Dont get the sense of illuminative subject from this  Also I dont care for the left compostional lines that cut the photo  They would have been better left out
Too bad that you can see some straws it takes away from the general impression of floating in time which is very nice Maybe a different lighting would have helped even if Im not sure
i feel like the attention to the subject  the pelican is drawn away by the boats
Great capture and perfect subject for the challenge
Now this one I know is Advanced because I have seen pictures of this sculpture before But what a great subject for this challenge I hope it fools lots of people
Some very very strong symmetry and repeating patterns in the main subject area there  Certainly grabs the challenge topic by the throat
Hello from the Critique Club After viewing the photo I have some suggestions for you First its a great subject and the depiction of desolation is pretty well there However the photo has some definate focus issues And the moth seems to almost be blown out with very little detail and clarity Centering and shooting straight down also seems to take away Perhaps shooting at an angle and focusing on your subject and then recomposing your photos Dont be afraid to compliment your photo with some editing sharpening and adjusting colors brightness and contrast Overall the photo scored about where I would have scored it Good luck in future challenges
The one leaning palm behind the left column sort of disturbs the vertical line of the column in some way and at the same time gives the edge of the column something solid in the B G to define it  Its a complex picture and there are a lot of elements that seem to be not exactly working in unison to bring out a strong subject or make the viewers eye move through it to a subject Its a good scene to study  The bright sky in the B G probably dinked the score pretty hard since it was in a F S challenge
this photo lacks a subject and overall lacks a point of interest
excellent subject here and meets the challenge 100 on problem i see is blow highlights and sky in BG good luck 8
Sorry it lacks interest re subject matter
Great subject  perhaps a tighter crop would have focused on that textured surface and make the mine pop more from the background
I find your subject interesting not sure about the border
Nice angle but im not sure i like the subject
Not really sure what your subject is supposed to be
I think youve got some really interesting subject matter in here and the shot is well composed but I think the lighting is really hurting this picture Theres a visible light source but then theres these really harsh shadows which are clearly coming from a spot light offcamera If you still have this set up available to you Id be really interested to see what itd look like using just the light from the candle and a longer exposure time I think it might really bring out some of the interesting textures on the typewriter and leather cover which are being lost to shadow or washed out from the harsh light
Very good still life subject and shadows
I love the type of technique where we use a subject to direct our gaze to the actual subject  well done
I think the artificiallyaged technique works well with this subject  nice to see another something in BW too
Harsh and gritty  fits the subject matter well
This photo has potential  I would like the subject to be in sharper focus  Advanced editing rules apply in this challenge thus some of the dirt specks could have been cloned out
I really like this picture  The tree is a great subject because it has very good detail and but it also gives a very hunting mood to the picture  Very cool
A sombre subject given a sombre feel with the foggy lighting but I would have preferred it without the foreground tree branches
This image is very simple in subject and composition and I like that its always nice when a photo takes you somewhere  and I cant help but wonder where that path goes Theres a couple of pieces of rubbish in the leaves that could be cloned out but I quite like this one 7
As for the comparison to Konadors original I think you took a good idea and really ran with it Besides giving meaning to the heart shadow you have made many other significant improvements I like the softer contrast for illustrating love I think the softer heartshaped general lighting is better and of course the printed pages give a purpose to the whole image
Really nice but first impression is a vertical picture of a very vertical subject
I like this a lot Perfect subject for BW I am trying to decide if I want more contrast  it seems to be missing something but something small
Im not fond of the subject altho it does suggest a little bit of anarchy  Nice clarity and high definition of the wood grain  I also find the background distracting but love the BW look  well done 7
An image that demonstates the subject matter of the challenge in spectacular fashion with excellant DOF and color control Both a technical and artistic success
I really like the subject and the shot is good  I would have preferred to see the subject moved closer to the left hand side and more negative space on the right including the whole smoke cloud
Beautiful image  I would have cropped out just a little bit more of the sky to make the girls more of the subject of the picture
The sun streaks on your subject are slightly distracting to the overall composition of this photo
Well hued Not a lot of interest except as a subject study  Could be a little sharper
This picture is very very clear but I think the main subject is a little too far away
Fairly standard subject and composition made a little more interesting with the sepia treatment
Outstanding conceptual accomplishment I applaud you for your vision The technical details however are somewhat deficient Its very low contrast especially on the right and I think you could have gone for a tighter crop The impact of your subject is diminished somewhat by the composition and may have been stronger with a more centered approach Love the border though
I REALLY like this one but there is a bit if an issue in my opinion I love the sun but that seems to be the main subject whereas the water is but a minor detail in the photo I am not saying that this does not meet the challenge but I just feel like the water should have been more of the subject rather than just a minor detail
what do you mean with this photo i do not think the photo related to the subject of this challenge great photo though well done
The subject is getting lost in the background
depending on how nitpicky you want to be and i am being picky based on an imagebyimage basis but this one as is has caused my brain to jar i like the presented center subject with the arch ways but the buildings in the top leftbottom right are detracting from the image in my opinion they are not equally symmetrical even in a diagonal sense the topmost building is closer to symmetrical but the round one just has no companion
the subject is too close for a leading lines shot in my amature opinion Try a little distance next time and see how you like it Good luck
Lovely lighting The image has a very soft and silent feel to it which is kind of ironic given the subject matter Good job
Although the subjct is interesting it is a bit sterotypical  Nor is the subject the focal point of your image are my eyes are not drawn towards the red lights i have to look for them  not colors pop and the only impasis is the street light  Youve got the right idea next time try to step over some bounderies
this is for me bad subject for such challenge is it your best
with architecture shots it is very important to get your alignment correct in this case it appears that your image needs a slight counterclockwise rotation an angular subject such as this building is very unforgiving with the composition
This is a great shot but the subject seems structured while the background has no ryme or reason
Very cool Love how youve done the background Suits this awesome subject to a tee
First I think the subject is lovely and the lighting is just about perfect The use of green bokeh in the bg is excellent as it provides a metaphorical foil to the dying rose
nice clouds  subject is a little confusing and busy
I like the setting but the subject looks like a cardboard cutout closer maybe but wildlife are so difficult to photograph Ill give you an 8 for your nice moody background
Very nice portrait  Great entry for this challenge You need a delicate subject to really nail a Soft Focus picture and you nailed it  Nicely done Good luck in the challenge
My first impression is that this is a very clean tight photo
interesting subject  contrast are kinda bland
beautiful muted colorsnice approach to this subject
Dramatic lighting but the subject is too blurred
Interesting composition But with all the reflections I cant really tell whats going on or what the main subject is supposed to be Is this on a boat or in a restaurant or through the window of a shop
I really like this shot The subject is creative and the lighting is outstanding Very nicely done
My first impression is wow why didnt this score higher A nice and clean composition with a wonderful variety of circles I like to tell people they havent left enough breathing space for their subjects but in this case you have left enough room to make this work I like that is not looking into the largest negative space which is the crop chosen most often Yes the highlights are a tad overexposed Im not saying a photograph has to have a perfect exposure but in this case I dont think it adds anything to the photograph All in all a lovely photograph Keep up the good work
there is no story here no subject  even the light is flat  not interesting
This is a good quality photo technical wise  Your subject still has color blue jacket
I addition to the subject being static and fairly boring the guy on the right with the camera really doesnt help the composition
Too many dark shadow The subject is not clear if its going up or down
great subtle subject and I like the gradual transition to bleached left edge  a great trick to push the focus on the tip of the feather
Sorry doesnt do anything for me  Technically very good focus etc subject just does not have any impact in my eyes  Just being honest
Good main subject  you could crop out the top right corner and make the shot more effective
When I posted it as a general discussion image earlier in 2008 everyone thought the shot was great 
Great subject for this challenge  Id love however to see this shot either cropped closer to fill the frame with the sign or to see it taken from a different angle
Very nice bokeh in the background The main subject looks to be sharpened a little too much but at the same time it isnt quite in focus Wonderful pink color though
Great job on focal point for subject matter psart 8
A staple in my house Probably eat them almost weekly So I am connecting well with your subject from a foodie perspective From a photography perspective it is a bit lacking Snapshot feel to it cropped way too tight I think you could have been a bit more creative with the image Would gladly take an invite to come over and dine with you though
Abstract art in which the subject is represented by shapes and patterns rather than by a realistic likeness
A realy difficult subject very well done  That said the image doesnt really hold my interest  I think it needed something more in the foreground
A very nice shot the choice of black and white and a minimal subject matter is a great decision in submitting for this challenge  The way the dragonfly blends into the stick it is on works well in this one where in another challenge one might seek some distinction between the two  It just works well all elements together  Great job from the Great Job Baggie
This  image gives the impression that it is tilted  is this correct or is it a play on the hills  I like the strong line of the bridge and I like the bridge to the left  Adds good character  The truck in the middle I think should have been  left out  5
Very nice photo  I like the subject and composition here  10
Nicely done Sensitive lighting The focal point  subject are the same thing for me in this comp
sorry This isnt motion panning There is motion but motion panning involves tracking a moving subject with the result being a sharp subject and a blurred background Nice shot though  just not for this challenge
This is not MY kind of image but different people have different tastes and with a subject like this youre bound to get someone who is totally against the topic
Looks like theres been some motion blur here and youve used a ton of sharpening to try and correct it which unfortunately hasnt done wonders for the general quality of the shot
I like your subject but would prefer not to have seen any ground and get in closer to the tangle of cables
The heavy pink on the tree looks like a post processing effect Not sure if you intended to the horizon to be tilted The subject of the photo isnt doing a lot to illustrate the 1 second concept
This meets the subject  but as you see from your score this is treated slightly subjectively  the thing I take into account  is can the picture stand without the title  or does it really need the title to tell the story  For electricity it needs the title  but it is still a great night shot
Doesnt have a enough interest re subject matter
the pin cushion protea as the backdrop for this very unique piece of jewelry is very distracting though I like the idea Think the subject is just to large against the background Like the reflections on the subject from the protea May be tighter crop would help this for me crop in left and bottom a bit Not sure it could work
Lovely subject and angle of shot I hope it does well
I like it I like staring at it it gives me the impression different thoughts of self perceptions vanity humor death
Beautiful photo Colors are wonderful and the subject so sharp Very nice bokeh
To work for me I need some pattern or shape to draw my eye into the picture and create a subject for me to linger over
Even though I dont think this subject is very interesting by itself I think you have photographed it very well 7
Rich colors unknown subject or techniques really no idea what Im looking at which would be fine except that it doenst really catch my interest in any way  Perhaps its just too chaotic to really bring my focus to any real subject or patterns of interest
Dont really get whats the subject on this picture
the offcenter subject works well  nice contrast  I like the serious darkness of the face
If you showed me this image outside of this competition and asked me to describe it I would have ended with a blue border  The subject does not say blue to me
Im not sure if I like this photo for this subject but I do like the photo
a nice enough capture but compositionally it doesnt really blow me away  these shots are tough and i appreciate your effort  i guess the thing thats sticking me is that its not quite sharp enough for me to go wow you nailed it or not quite blurry enough to consider it art which even though it would defeat the purpose of the challenge would make for a cool shot  maybe a square crop would strengthen the image so as to keep it from feeling like the subject is on the cusp of flying out of the frame
2 I personally would have cropped out the bottom part of the pictureit does not add to the subject
I think your subject is great I like that are subjects are really lying on the thirds of the frame I am not sure if the soft focus was intentional or maybe there was a breeze blowing by  I think the movement does give your piece something interesting that draws the viewer in  I wonder if you had just focused on one flowers specifically and let the rest melt into the background it would have scored a little higher
This doesnt meet street photography for me too narrow a subject
good  you have a good subject and nice light
Overall the subject matter doesnt excite me very much
I gave this image a 9 because Im guessing that people dont like the fact that the subject is  it cannot be identified    i cannot ID it anyway  and Im in a weird mood
So my overall impression is distinctly blecch which I gather is what youre asking me to say  Be careful what you ask for
PLeasant bokeh on this one  The subject is fitting too 7
Haha nice title I wouldnt have gotten that impression of this shot without the title so I think its very fitting Also nice processing and use of focus The attention is definitely on the bird
Nice idea Its very noisy though and needs better focus Its a very appropriate subject matter though at a time of gratitude for whatever you have
the backgound could have been ironed or made more crinkly if thats your goal very good subject 
This is probably getting some DQ requests If indeed it is done within the basic editing rules it is good but I find the photo subject unappealing
A good effort but the subject leads the eye away from the pleasing textures and interesting details of the stone wall and wood  A good black and white conversion
crop subject location and lighting 7
As for the light it works fine here I guess you couldve boosted your whites via curves so that the snow was closer to white but its not a huge deal and a preference thing As is I think the offwhite snow works well with the general feel
The subject is not particularly original but the composition is excellent and hoists the image far above average
What just one comment I think this photograph is rather uninteresting I think it needs better subject or something that makes the traces a better subject Anyways I love the lighting and the post processing
My eye is not taken to the subject and too much seems to be going on in the background
Love this idea  Very nice interpretation of the subject challenge
Smaller DoF whouldve helped the subject to stand out better from the background The picture seems to be a bit broken because of the left part but overall it is a good picture
 Its a cute take on the subject
The idea is interesting but i find the subject is not illuminating
Your subject is not in focus
Awesome picture but the subject doesnt seem to have outlived its usefullness it is still on a track
This should have placed much higher Haters out there that vote for stuff that doesnt really fit the subject of the challenge but it just a nice photo No surprise really Still top 30 finish is good 
Congrats on the Brown Peter I speaks to me as post New Years Eve party after the fireworks are gone It was probably too ambiguous for the general DPC crowd well done
Great use of repetitive pattern and color Very good There is no clear subject in the photo itself but the lines and patterns are entertaining on their own 9
subject and background is at the same tonality
Not stagged  Good idea  If the subject moved back 2 steps smaller would help
A very well done pic  The roses draw the eye into the main subject of the pic and the monotone works well
A very appealing image for this challenge although a singular subject the lighting and processing is good7
Glass Housesone of my favorites  Anyway very good but perhaps a bit too much negative space in the general topright area
I like the general mood of this
A portrait is a painting photograph sculpture or other artistic representation of a person in which the face and its expression is predominant The intent is to display the likeness personality and even the mood of the person For this reason in photography a portrait is generally not a snapshot but a composed image of a person in a still position A portrait often shows a person looking directly at the painter or photographer in order to most successfully engage the subject with the viewer
The execution of this photo is your savior here  IMHO I dont think the creativity is great I think the subject is boring and it really doesnt adequately connect to the challenge  However the execution and overall image here is extraordinary  The mood is great the image is sharp and it stands out  Im giving it an 8 on shear execution  Great job GL
I like the elevated look in this shot  It gives an impression that the photo was shot from a tree top  The positioning of the path in the photo is very well done because it draws the eye into the photo  Well done and keep up the good work in 2005  8
A nice subject for this type of crop and it looks likes great shot of the moon  I would like to see the whole moon rather than cutting it off on two ends  Voted earlier
Well to the image The subject is not very intresting its from a very simple angle and I think that this sure could have been a good photo with some angle work and then some cool BW conversion or something
Would like to have subject show some eye contact with the camera Also it looks like your highlights are blown out I assume that this was taken around the noon hour Unless it is a cloudy day try to avoid this time because it gives you harsh shadows Go for in the morning or an hour or two before sunset Great idea and I love the lines that the trees make
The choice of subject and composition is excellent  Your processing has been done so very well not a hint of the over the top look that so often is seen when using Topaz
1st impression is a badly out of focus snapshot  Closer examination reveals odd reflections that are further distracting  Cant imagine what you intent was 4
Compositionally I think this works well The subject takes up much of the screen and the big shadows central to the image seems well placed  The grassy area on the right of the image is quite dark and for me doesnt add much to the image so for a nonshadow challenge that area might have been more distracting
What a wonderful subject and a nice view Nit pick but I think cropped too close on the right  In this case both should be exactly equal  One of the top shots IMO
A beautiful serene shot but I have to mark it down a bit for this challenge because without the title I get absolutely no sense of failure Yes hes alone but I dont get the impression hes unhappy about that
You may have been shooting during a shady time of the day as the scene lacks interesting highlights and shadows  Its flat to my eye  Pretty nice clouds out there  This subject has potential  I think it needs a bit more interesting composition
I like the use of the red subject as a reflection off the window
Almost missed the portrait mixed in I like it after I saw the subject third from left Very well done One must wonder though would this have been better if subject would have contrastedIE different solid color Nice lighting Good flow
i like the variety of colours and also the picture gives a clear impression of what it would be like to touch the toad  frog it conveying texture very well  i personally might have tried cropping within the confines of edges of the glass container as the background or the fact that the picture isnt quite level is more of a distraction  this picture is also let down slightly by the scratchy  smeary looking surface of the glass  if you have photoshop elements the heal tool might have helped a bit  i have noted the presence of shadows but i dont think its really a prominent enough a feature to really fit the challenge  i do still like it though  the more i look at it the more striking it feels  its also cute  erm 6
interesting subject stands out very well Good work
Not sure how this is a silhouette  That aside the subject of the image is unclear  the focus appears to be on the vertical scaffolding rather than on the concrete block  shadow
i think a little to bright or overexposed but the subject is great
Nice shot  The flames look like brush strokes  I like the subject looking right at the camera challenging the viewer
great treatment of subject
I dont understand the concept that the water is distracting when the subject is a girl playing in a sprinkler
Because the subject should be the A the bird is a distraction from the main subject I like the bird though
great for a reflection but does not fit subject well
Nice contrasting tones But subject is a bit dull overall would of benefitted from a longer shutter speed
I think the picture would have been better if your subject wasnt looking straight into the camera Closed eyes would have suggested dreaming relaxing Good colour tones here 6
there are so many nice submitions  I motion for a get together of photographers  I am by no means one myself but the opertunity to have an event and to swap ideas and pool your general knowlage would be I think a good thing  The opertunity to share points of view to communicate your way of looking at things to suck the whole visual potential out of the moment and photograph it all  To convay your experiances to the world in the most direct way possible  To be poets of the lens  To show the world life where most of the rest of the world sees desolation money or just another tree or just another sunbeam  The importance of art is to comunicate and the focus of photography is communicating the now  I think a good photograph moves as you look at it is inspired to be more than ink on paper but a living reflection of the universe  Please pass this on
Age and grace are always worthy subjects and from that standpoint this works on several levels The overall blue feel of the image is a plus but just on the edge of being overdone Intense and purposeful the models expression conveys a sense of elegance wisdom and time Unfortunately the rather blank sky does not help this image at all Additionally the author might have done better to get a closer capture of the subjects face which is the images most interesting feature The use of bokeh could have been better and with a closer look at the subject from a different angle to provide a contrasting background would have improved this image tremendously The author might want to use some post processing magic with the sky and see if the image can be enhanced with a substitution or better treatment A good worthy entry into the challenge
the subject is supposed to be the sand granular but the title implies the subject is the footwear
I find the subject a bit confusing it isnt clear what Im looking at so my eye keeps moving around trying to identify the bits and pieces
The processing sort of overtakes your subject a bit
really lovely beautiful shot but I dont think it fits well with the theme I know the tree is in the foreground but since the barn is so in focus I cant even say which is the true subject of this photo
beautiful use of negative space and luminous subject
Although the water in this one is very calm and the stick is a great subject that does not interrupt the calmness of the water what I found to be distracting to the overall calmness here were the trees and their reflections  It just drew the eyes into it too much distracting from the overall serenity  Great job from the Great Job Baggie
look forward to seeing the explanation Is it just PS A little too washed out for subject Earth
oh yeah now this is nice great contrast and subject matter you may lose some points from some for blowing out the background but i feel it brings more focus on the train
Like my attempts sharpness of subject is very hard to achieve perfectly when dealing with macro  subject is a less than interesting
I like the title I also have an image in my portfolio with the same name but a different subject 
Im sure folks either love the partial desat or hate it  I think it really highlights your subject well
All is surely calm A dash of ripples actually makes to see the stillness in contrast Very well executed and the size of subject is just in line Zen paintings I feel there was no need to horizon on this photo Simple reflects in water would also have just worked fine or maybe even better IMO Goodluck8
The feeling of contemplation of your lone subject in this snowbound landscape comes across very strongly which from your title is exactly your intention I presume I like the high key effect which is broken up by the dark clothing of your model I like the general simplicity from the foreground stand to the background structures and trees which although fairly complex is reduced to simplicity by the lighting and uniform nature of the sky
I had to look at this a half dozen times before I realized that the subject was not a work of Modern Art but just a toy It is your photo that is a work of art
Sorry but I think the texture layer takes away looks dirty from what could be an interesting subject to photograph
need to be harder and more tonal range also think adding grain will help but nice subject  ir
Yukky subject but well photographed
This is so funny The only thing hurting you is the basic subject in comparison to other subjects but its nicely executed and creative
Beauty is a subjective thing I know  In my scoring and comments Im trying to score based on NOT whether or not I would think a particular subject beautiful but on whether the photographer has succeeded in creating a beautiful photo  I look for the elements of color lines focus and dof interest lighting  and a certain element of grace and lovlieness   Im looking for a unique and creative  appeal for the highest scorers  The description says to create a photo that makes the viewer think thats beautiful so it will undoubtedly be very subjective   This is what Im putting at the start of all of my comments  and I hope it is helpful
and even the pelican nice contrasts and subject
A fairly interesting image in the way it isolates the word mute from the rest of the machinery through the shallow DOF but I find the dusty surface very distracting in a detrimental sort of way its taking away from the subject which is not an amazingly absorbing subject in the first place I do like the way the DOF is working here and the OOF elements if anything an even wider aperture would have made more of the G8 less distinctive and isolated the mute word more effectively
Gorgeous scene Im not really feeling the vignetting It seems to take attention away from the subject in this case
Wayyyyy awesome the detail and subject blow me way
First impression is a nice and clean picture but I dont like the apparent trail of the ball I am new here but assume it is within the advanced editing rules but beats me how it is done other that some serious postproc
First impression this is a crisp and believably saturated image The setting is obvious and the subject clearsomeone enjoying the outdoors on an overcast day Well I  he or she is enjoying it
Interesting would be better with less void at bottom and needs to be a landscape format not vertical  Too subject is too dead centered
Lovely and crispexcellent subject matter and compositionperhaps the light is a little too bland
This photo has a nice mood to it  I also think the centered subject works nicely in this composition because of the mutiple leading lines  Excellent shot
Well  looking at your description it seems like you have a general understanding where this shot is lacking The lighting is weak and the colors are flat The orange tint to the picture overall is unflattering I think a tweak in levels or curves could have brought out the brightness and natural colors of your subjects
Almost too minimalist the subject is not strong enough to hold my attention
Nice subject for this challenge 9
While I think having one subject against a solid background is a good interpretation of the challenge the subject is too small in this photo to hold my interest
Compositionally the placement of the barrels is a little bland Try moving around your subject looking through the viewfinder before pressing the shutter button You can then find a more dynamic compostion and eliminate any unnecessary distractions
One of the elements of bokeh is a relatively shallow DOF in order to make the subject stand out from the background Sorry but it isnt apparent in this image
nice pic major subject easy to pick up a little busy  but thats the way it is  you captured that well theres so much to look at but i keep coming back to him i like the yellow  the amount of it and i like the line that is created by something steel accross the bottom of the pic
I think this would be improved if most of the long hair was cropped out  there was more negative space that the subject could look into  Love the soft lighting  the focus
I like what the slight motion blur does to give this scene an impression of depth I dont feel it is abstract imagery however
Great capture  Something gives me the impression that this is  self portrait but I may be wrong  You have really conveyed the feeling of relaxation  7
congratulations on winning PostLuminous Award i expected yours to score much higher gave you a 10 but thats life blur doesnt go well with general voters taste
Interesting subject though Im not sure exactly what it is
If cropping would allow I may have tried to push the girl even further in the corner  My impression of zen is large areas of negative space  This would have been accentuated even more with the girl further from the center
When photographing try not to put your subject bang slap in the middle
A good workmanlike photo of a subject that isnt that interesting to me
This screams HDRrich in texture Nice choice of subject for this challenge
Nice exposure especially in the shadows under the top These lines lead well in to the photograph but there seems to be subject matter lacking at the point of interest Also the photo seems to tilt to the right I dont know if it was intended but it is distracting
main subject is not the bear at least we should see his face reversing him had also hidden the manufacturers tag but its a very good portrait of your daughter very good composition good lighting though a bit too dark at left where the chair merges with the background perfectly matching props ie her dress and the chair go very well with her red hair  had chosen an equivalent color for the thin border Note its better to add the border after resizing otherwise it will look blurred and have rounded corners as shown here
Very nice i like it but the rope is just a support and not the full subject
Would be more effective if the subject wasnt in the center
This is great colours subject whatever it is and the lines One of my favourites
I think it looks very strange how the subject has so much grain and the background is mostly smooth
very prettynice subject isolation
Nice subject with very dramatic processing Well done
the image feels oversharpened to my eyes and the silvery metallic sheen doesnt work for me nice subject matter with a lot of character though the spot of dark on the right hand side of the background could have been removed as well to improve the attentiondraw to the main subject
Very nice photo  I dont really have anything that I would change  I do however feel it lacks something in the subject that tells a story  I give it a 9
Your repeating main subject is a littlehmmm I just dont know There just doesnt seem much to look at
The subject didnt resonate with me
Very cute subject so soft and fluffy  That said the subject probably hurt you a little bit because it is lacking the DPC Wow factor  That probably cost you a few points
Good subject for stock but the focus is not on the eye where it needs to be to sell as stock
When you dont make it clear that your intention was a dark photo though strong contrasting elements and subject matter then it feels as though the photo was simply underexposed through lack of technique
You chose the subject to be outside looking in rather than the camera  You did not provide much of interest on inside or outside other than the kilroy like view of the subject  A 4
Good subject but its lacking sharpness
With this image you invite the infamous bell curve This image reveals nothing about the subject but on the other hand it is more a graphical reprentation geared towards a novel effect I will be on the higher end of the bell curve simply because I like these images Bumping up
Great placement of the subject compositionally and against the backdrop  Very nicely done
nice subject  but I think wxposure is a bit too long this cause a flatered image and also some color castings
Cute I think a more centered subject would better work here Its not really rule of thirds The soft focus really does go well with the soft and cuddly goose
At the end of the day I still gave this a 6 as I felt the subject worked well in this challenge A better focus would undoubtedly have increased my score
cirlces are not the subject here  they are secondary to the childs goggled gaze
wish the subject was in crisp focus
Very pretty  I love how your subject stands out
A very interesting image with much to look at The rich brick red against the grass and then the white of the pleasant subject all combine to give forth a sense of pleasant thoughts as you so aptly named it Bump
Let me start off by expressing my sympathy for the loss of your friend  You choose a very tough subject to sell in a challenge at DPC  Suicide makes people uncomfortable as well it should  Regarding your image I think you did a great job communicating your message  There is no emotion more extreme than taking your own life  Reading through the comments you received I see that people were split between liking the BW and wishing it was in color  I think the choice of BW was a good one and served the image well  I think you might have scored a little better with a different conversion method to make it BW  I prefer the channel mixing method explained in the DPC tutorial by fotomannforever  This method would give you the option of adjusting between the red green and blue channel to make the blood show up better and to provide better contrast in the rest of the image  The more you boost the red channel above than the green and blue the more the blood will lighten up  Give it a read and play around a bit
Magical profile and the image is just perfect but not sure about the subject matter for zen
Nice shot I think since the subject is looking to the left in this photo positioning him off center to the right to give more of a sense that he is looking at something wouldve made the photo stronger
I think I would have rated this one higher if the subject was focused and the water was moving or if the water was more focused that the subject was moving 6
nice photojournalistic type of shot lacking a bit though in sharpness especially at the center subject maybe your ap was too open
Its difficult to write a comment after that I read your comment the black and white seems flat and the cut on the head isnt beautiful but is a self portrait and this change the comment its difficult a self portrait but if there are two subject there are majors problems
More than 7 subject in the photo
Your subject looks a little more crumpled than Hanaes MAK  this distracts a little as the folds lead the eye away from the phone
Good leading lines with the tracks  Perhaps a somewhat lackluster subject to some
interesting subject and use of focus
Too much junk  Nothing dominates as a subject or place for your eye to land
Confusing  in a good way  how the reflections that seem more distant are larger than the perfectly composed subject who seems to be sitting across the aisle from the photographer
A portrait is a painting photograph sculpture or other artistic representation of a person in which the face and its expression is predominant The intent is to display the likeness personality and even the mood of the person For this reason in photography a portrait is generally not a snapshot but a composed image of a person in a still position A portrait often shows a person looking directly at the painter or photographer in order to most successfully engage the subject with the viewer
Most nature shots I would consider shoehorned into this challenge but I like that you went the other way and your pic actually exudes youth Still the subject is indeed millions of years old I like the thought it provokes
A nice subject and pleasant bokeh  The colours make for interest as do the gentle delicate edges of the flowers 7
I wish the title werent needed to portray the subject matter of the challenge topic   Still I love the image   Shes beautiful
a gorgeous subject and the lighting and details are perfect  WOW  
Interesting how this image transitions from greyscale tones into a pure bw Im not sure what the message is but the impression given by the title was this may be a scene viewed through the eyes of a rapist Its kind of creepy I am very curious what your intended message was
the subject is the trafic signal
Youve chosen a subject with a lot of potential With just a little more contrast the white could have stood out starkly against the dark stormy sky
First impression is honestly WTH What does this have to do with ninjas The top of the lemon is way blown out as well as the upper edge of the lenscap and the DOF is not working for the lenscap since parts of it are out of focus and the parts that are in focus arent sharp enough
There are a few technical factors that will hold down its score The area betwen the clouds is grossly overexposed and will be distracting to most viewers The overall general image quality is not particualrly good and the focus is very soft Even though the image appears to be in color there really isnt much thee and would be better if it were straight black and white Lastly the image size is small and those images generally are voted lower by viewers
This is an interesting subject and wellcomposed I do wish the face were lit even just a little bit more though I had to look really close to make out the word on the left eye The face is more interesting than the throat which is where the majority of the light is
A good study in highkey but not terribly intiguing subject matter
May not be conventional wisdom but I prefer to have at least one side not visible past an inside edge of the structure or the tree whatever  For me it makes the subject feel less posed
A worthy subject but feels flat to me Try increasing midtone contrast
Beautiful composition  Hate to say it but there the subject is escaping though she may be  Still a seven from me on this quite artistic capture
points for interpretation was the subject sleeping at night
A little too much going on  Maybe zero in on a subject or two  As is its pretty crowded  Nice depth of field
I like this shoteven though the chairs get a little grainy and the corner of the roomfocus stays on the platesgood subject for BW
I love the way the apples are arrangedgood perspective the way youve used three different coloured apples but they blend in as they touch one another which gives the subject continuity Good work
oh yes sums up my impression quite accurately One of the few movies I actually know
this is well done  Simple subject yet effective  Lighting is well done
I think the voters will want one of the arms to look like the subject is taking a selfie to score well
very nice I like the red shirt on the climber it helps your subject to stand out
Artistic 7pts I like the placment of the subject within the four sides of the frame
The short definition of Bokeh from KenRockwellcom which I am using for voting on this challenge Bokeh describes the rendition of outoffocus points of light Definietly present  Is the subject enhanced by the bokeh of the background Absolutely Wow shot WOW
I think that the reflection is well captured although I feel that the subject could do with being a bit brighter
I see the triangle however I see the phrase Why Row Sail First and formost and seeing how that is not the point of the photo I would have tried to find a subject that had more of a presence
Good capture  Easy to identify the subject even in silhouette  8
Nice subject but lost in the darkness to me
I dont know about the other commenters but I like it  The subject is a bit unusual but why does everyone expect usual  This shot took imagination to take and to enjoy Good thinking outside of the DPC box
unfortunately no stars on the sky like in the mountains and a bit too noisy and too much of the dark sky picture in general a bit too dark and a main subject is missing nice scene though seems to be an interesting city
The drama inherent in how the subject was revealed is good but its a rather stock piece seen in other images and not particularly creative Having said that its still a great image  strong and purposeful mood piece that would work well in any other venue or challenge and place well
Artistic If youre seeing a murky yellow sky on your LCD but see an orange sky through your viewfinder something needs correcting  I like the gull balancing out the comp but the main impression is flat and drab  Lacks the pop factor so loved here
As a homebrewer the subject is obviously of interest to me but the photo itself I find lacking
Very twisty    Not a very interesting subject matter IMO but meets the challenge
Isnt this a vertical picture of a vertical subject that you rotated
Superb angle unfortunately the subject is just blurred enough that I found it difficult to see clearly what I was looking at Love the concept perhaps need to desaturate the reds just a tad theyre a bit overblown Nice work
slow speed works very well and subject is right on
Yor image is too small doesnt really show the subject the bee well and had nothing to do with stationery
Too much bland sky I realize the road is below but maybe a diferent angle on the subject would have improved the composition
border detracts in a major way  subject sharp good composition  gl
zebra too distracting to me reduces the subject birds appeal
Wonderful catch and subject matter the technique very good While I really wouldnt class it as a true in the style it has captured the moment 8
I like this very very much  Gives the dog a very mysterious and dignified look  Enough details stand out that Im not visually confused by but instead am intrigued by the blending of subject and background
Nice detail but I cant get beyond the subject matter
Too dark The tree doesnt show up enough to be the subject of the image
Composition  Good placement of subject and light but very oof with light streaming through the wings hurting the challenge topic  Blur factor on background and subject make this seem very overprocessed on a hohum image
The photographer has included a strong subject in the photo but has not used that subject as the source for the shadow
This is a great picture but how is it obsolete this is a beautifull setting and composition Its actually a great picture but I dont see the link with hte subject of the challenge
Overall a good job Work on your subject presentation emphasis
this I really like the grain works and the subject suits the Bw treatment  I have apadlock one went for colour but yours has mine beaten hands down  10
Well taken focused balanced The subject isnt that interesting for me but that doesnt take away from the score of the picture
Almost didnt notice the subject until I read the title
Your subject is a bit too blurry  Her face and glasses are a bit fuzzy  I might have bumped up the shutter speed a bit more to get more of her in focus  Also the shot doesnt stir any emotion in me and is a dull composition
Excellant black and white conversion that wasnt fully appreciated on first ratings speed review On comment review there is one issue that immediately makes an impression and that is the very slightly overdone white spotlight That being said the rest of the image is technically excellant and a good example of the zone system at its best Given that the spot light is actually the reason this image has its own wowpop factor the image is rerated from a 6 to an 8 Well done
An interesting choice for meeting the subject challenge  very abstract and different  The image could be a little more dramatic A little more focus would have helped this image score higher A good solid entry into the challenge
crop closer to subject for better negative space
Heyyy Wendy  look at you    Beautiful work and you know I adore the subject matter  I havent entered anything on DPC for a while but I happened to stop in and couldnt help but notice your winner  Big congrats on the red and thanks so much for the mention
This image has a subject but could use some sharpness Thats the beauty of Macro Photography to me being able to see textures that ordinarily unnoticed
Colour and saturation is great There just seems to be a bit of a angleperspective thing that give the impression that the photograph has been squashed vertically Hope that makes sense
Beautiful BW image you have perfectly stopped the motion of the bird and the wing detail looks excellent in BW  Only small critism is the subject is not moving into the negative space Best of luck 8
The main point of this photo is out of focus  You want the main subject to be completely in focus but it looks like she moved at the last moment
Tough subject I mean the benches yet you made the composition interesting using the colors and simmetry And the couple and title just broke what would be a dry image Good job
living in amish country myself i find it very surreal whenever i still see them in their daily life routines in general till this day very nice shot
Granular is not the subject  would say the ants are Otherwise great shot
Although it looks a bit over processed I think this is underrated  Very nice subject 
good lighting setting and subject for this challenge
I like this hazy day photo  The subject really stands out on its own and the faded background shows enviroment without being too busy  Very well done
Interesting  I think the subject is a bit too far away and the fence I am guessing is a little distracting  Nice bokeh
for blurred shots to work IMO you have to be able to identify the subject
This is great subject matter
What a relief after hearts and chocolates I quite like them but at DPC I long for a different approach than the cards one might get at Hallmark Now on the subject at hand Lupercalia was a festival observed in Feb  a sort of cleansing ritual Lupercus is god Pan  oh yes still celebrated in Feb So you beat around the Valentines bush Clever I would change the head of the shepherd though
I like your choice of subject  something so recognizably red in BW The lighting is also pretty good
Nice to come across a photo with a theme as well as a subject  
Interesting macrolove the blurred greens in the background  Nice sharp subject too   8
Good taste and picture Great subject and inpiring picture You deserve a ribon
You did such a great job getting the steel wool ring centered on your subject then you put the subject slightly off center Why
Good bokeh but the subject is a little unappealing
strong expression a different cropping would have made it stronger IMO either cropping off the right side or having the subject more centered
fits the subject what more can i say
the red cast does not help your subject
This is unfortunate that the roses dominate this portrait of the man Or were you taking it on the sly  Great subject nevertheless
The main subject looks a bit out of focus and those two little marks on the background are distracting  As you couldnt clone them out because of basic editing rules you perhaps should have spent a little time setting up the shot to get it just right
A natural subject for searching Cats are always after something
Definitely meets the challenge and exhibits proper bokeh  The subject matter leaves me wanting not because its a flower  I have nothing against flowers  it just lacks a wow factor for me  Good luck
I like this shot I think its well composed I like the off centered subject and the perspective of the line of the road going off into the distance However its posed and feels forced in a way I think it could have been more powerful if it felt more natural  a hitchhiker doesnt sit in the middle of the road after all Nicely executed 6
Of all the various ant shots for this challenge I like this one the best The perspective DOF and crop all give the impression that it is taken from an ants point of view
Very prettya tad busy though and the subject seems more to be the young woman than the tree
I love this shot but I feel that it would have been stronger if the subject wasnt in the middle Great contrast and sky
The subject would suit a black background but again there appears to be some areas on either side of the frame that are a slightly different colour to the centre of the background Small little details but on voting I would be looking at all these things
Great subject and processing  Unfortunately you have the same problem all the other vertical shots do I have to scroll to see the entire thing
Very cool and very well shot  It seems like you chose a window as a light or modified your modifier haha either way it was a wise decision and it first the subject perfectly
Really great topic however your subject is in pretty bad shape If you did this same shot with a nicer looking strawberry youd have a winner
I would not get that the subject here was electricty  perhaps a man perhaps waiting perhaps isolation
The only reason I know your subject is busking is because you said so
Nice look to this The water has the rich appearance I like The subject may be a touch too far to the left
I just dont see a subject here  Its obvious theres a circle there and some snow which is nice and pretty but with everything jumbled together theres nothing to draw the eye correctly
I have to be honest my initial impression was negative until I saw the challenge you have entered it for and now I understand the reason for the processing so with that in mind The house is the only sharp feature in the image and therefore becomes a stronger focal point than I assume you wanted it to be Personally I dont think it detracts especially given your title you want it to emphasise the buildings as it does
I really like the contrast and subject of this one I think a bit more space to the left might be interesting
Beauty is a subjective thing I know  In my scoring and comments Im trying to score based on NOT whether or not I would think a particular subject beautiful but on whether the photographer has succeeded in creating a beautiful photo  I look for the elements of color lines focus and dof interest lighting  and a certain element of grace and lovlieness   Im looking for a unique and creative  appeal for the highest scorers  The description says to create a photo that makes the viewer think thats beautiful so it will undoubtedly be very subjective   This is what Im putting at the start of all of my comments  and I hope it is helpful
subject matter a little too plain but good idea
Murex I think  A great subject and well shot too
Absolutely awesome  Love how this subject blends so well into the shot  Nice sky to contrast with the rest of the shot
Stunning a tad noisy but the impact of the subject and composition make up for it
Good contrast between subject and background I would have loved to see more detail in the head Nice capture never the less
nice shading of blues and subject
The board had nice detail but the main subject seemed overwhelmed by it
You know Maria this is a super great photo of a beautiful child It could be I am so very opposed to harming children I likely let it get the best of me I actually thought it was a winner a 10 for sure You were too close to the subject to see what I was seeing Anyway a bit of PS to lighten the area I pointed out and a wall hanger for sure
Had to google the name  I suppose if he turned his vision onto an architectural subject he might tend to cover it with uniform sterile white dots instead of the organic blobs and gradients that cover his closeup wartsandall human portraits
Id flip this so the subject would be facing the other way so when my eyes come in from the left of the photo I wouldnt come into the back of her head  Good composition with subject not dead center good rule of thirds  Clothing is very distracting would have preferred a solid color dress with all the spots of color around the photo from the flowers  Lighting is a bit harsh on the arms and face making subject look bigger which the patterned dress also does
The subject matter is not original but the way it is presented here is  Good job
not only is the capture on this great but the deail of the granular subject you were able to catch at the same time is impressive
this is a really GREAT idea for a phototechnically it looks really nice  i would love however to see it taken from a more interesting anglejust so your subject isnt DEAD centered  good luck
Great subject which begs the question why you felt the need to coat in pixel syrup Im genuinley interested to see your original here because I find myself yearning the detail that has been excluded That dead bark must be rich with interest
Really like the shallow DOF and subject is very sharp 8
I like how the title matches the photo  However Im not crazy about the subject being centered vertically I keep wanting something interesting to be above or below the car Id probably like it better even with just white above the car but nothing below the carso my eye is drawn down to the subject
Wow what a stunning image  Beautiful exposure composition texture and subject matter  This is a clear winner in my book  Id have given it first place
very powerful  and the figure pointing to the left gives the impression of turning its back to the onlooker
Awesome angle Not over the top convergence Just right Great subject to shoot as well
Interesting subject and lighting The image could have benefited from a little bit of depth IMHO
I love the crispness of the subject against the softness of the greenery Great contrast
Really great and lovely photo but I dont think it meets the challenge The tree is not the main subject of this photo in fact its pretty much unimportant I think if you cropped the island out youd have a much stronger shot
I love this skyit suits the subject well
This gives the impression of being outside as in a courtyard rather than in an empty room  I do like the way the color of the chair brings out the blue in the bricks
Clever subject for the challenge I think Id have liked a little more space around the top and bottom so that the drops can breathe a bit more
I know Im missing something that everyone else is getting with this shot  Cant seem to figure out what the subject is suppose to be then numerals or the chains
My dilemma in deciding how to score this it that the subject of interest is the storm ie most of the image and those stormy skies also constitute the negative space So the negative space does not add to subject it is the subject On further reflection Ill consider the band of crepuscular rays which I like as the subject
I really like this The sepia tones add a lot The subject matter is very pleasing
I like the clarity of the subject and the dullness of the background I think I might have cropped a little more of the left side  that big black stripe seems too much somehow
Nice shot  You might try a tighter crop the leaves on the right tend to take a little away from the main subject
I love the subject line right centered and the simplicity in monotone  dark contrast really makes this photo  great job
I dont see a connection to the challenge The photo itself is washed out Im assuming the subject of the photo is the building in the center but youve titled it rock Looks like a beautiful place to visit
nice old house good subject selection
Wow you got robbed on this one dude  Im learning that in order to do well at dpchallenge it seems you have to have a dramatic sky in the background  That is such a shame  This was an outstanding shot and should have finished much higher  Too many dramatic sky shots where the main subject is so much less interesting then this shot  Get em next time
This is lovely bokeh frames the subject really nicely
This is so sharp and clear   Youve made an uninteresting subject interesting
I think you might have done better if you had a less obstructed view of the subject of your picture  5
Good choice of subject for stock 8
Nice idea Im not sure what the subject is so it leaves me a little confused
Does not show what the subject is just cannot tell that this is a pizza joint by the angle of the shot
Nice one Terje Good thing he wasnt wearing the regular general under his lip 
Most likely the winner of the challenge this is just excellant and perfectly matches the challenge subject not to mention that the image is very nicely composed
One of the really nice things is skateboarders white shirt parallel to upper rim  Agree about tilt  also think a third or so cropped off the bottom making a sort of question mark but still S ish would highlight subject better
Nice soft image in profile but it doesnt really meet the challenge of a backlit subject which appears solid and without much detail
The border is distracting and the subject is poorly lit
Wow but this is definately a 2 tree subject without the title  the title gets you an extra point
not sure Id have used all of that dead space on the right good subject though
First thoughts  this definitely met the challenge  Hot air balloons always make for a good subject imho and nice work catching the flame  That flame definitely added a bit of something special  The colors seem realistic and not overly saturated  Nothing wrong with the light although nothing particularly special about it either  Darn the morning not having been a nice pink sky morning huh
INteresting interesting choice of colour why green  the poweline breaks it in half though  Having the copter in the middle of the frame also doesnt provoke any movement to it and makes it incredibly simple  Try experimenting with different positioning of the main subject in the frame to see what effects come out  2
With a subject done so many times you really need to be more creative with your composition and flawless in your execution to really grab attention
Nice  I like the angle and its nice to see people as the subject for a change  people within the urban landscape I also love her tiny feet
Very creative and sharp  Im not sure your subject fills the frame  Still a very good shot so Ill give you an 8
There seems a general air of softness here  perhaps an extra final sharpen after downsizing
YesI like it Perfect subject matter
Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous  Absolutely stunning location and the  subject is a cute as they come  Composition processing and colour like wow
Free Studies offer all of us to explore our world and find and share something special in our own time and place It is when we as photographers take a mundane subject and turn it into art
nice compositiongreat colorthe bridge is not the primary subject here though
Nice example of Bokeh It would be nicer if the subject was slightly sharper then he is
Would be better if you were straight on to the subject so that the lines of the window were level   Still I like the subject
Technically the first thing that strikes me is that it is out of focus  However upon second glance I can see that the glasses do indeed seem focused  However since the face takes up more of the frame and is the primary focus no pun intended the overall impression that one takes away from the shot is that it is soft
I have seen a lot of dragonfly photos in this challenge  but this one stands out somehow for me I admire the way the subject stood out from a green monochromatic background
I love Bokeh  and it is a great technique to emphasize a subject by placing the subject in context in a specific environment  This is a key point for the photo you posted in the challenge
Oh yes This was my exclamation on seeing it on my screen Im a sucker for motion blur anyway and this really appeals to me I love the curve of the motion and subtle detail The grainy feel adds to it together with the erotic impression of the female nude in an abstract form of presentation its all so appealing has to be a fave I wish you good luck with it
Simple and meets challenge I just wish there was a central subject to focus on in the photograph
Youre probably going to get hammered for having too small a shot  That doesnt bother me quite as much as it does many but with such a simple subject having it centered doesnt really work that well  Try framing it so that it shows up either one third from the left or the right instead  A contrast boost might also be in order as the scene seems a little washed out  The subject also doesnt seem to be that compelling
I think the Illuminating subject is lost Nice capture though
THe main subject is not in focus a little bit blur
The subject is probably not something one would expect to score high at DPC and I think the aggression shown in the face also likely helped lower your score it may have faired a lot better in a street shot type challenge though I would have liked to see some reference or story as to why he was angry I guess because as it is its a guy with a contorted face and very little else would it hold my attention long enough to consider my vote No most likely not although thats just as likely a failing with me than your image
I like how the subject is looking into the distance and her pole is pointing in the same direction making me look there too  The highlights on the water and her silouette are such nice complements
very good on subject selection but can improve on the photoquality
Wonderful colors The smoothness of the subject goes well with the flowing water The background looks a little like a monitor screen It seems like Im seeing that grid that you get if shot too close to it Not bad but I think a cleaner version would work better
The female figure is a perfect subject for this form factor I had some of those too 
Cool subject
I might have cropped 13 off the bottom  This was so full and busy I was spending too much time hunting for the actually triangles it there really are quite a few but spread out and lost sometimes  But in general  Ioved the geometrics and the colors  8
The tones used are perfect for the subject and the mood it is conveying
My very first impression was that this scene is very twisted  Good photographic eye spotting this  I like the photo and hope it does well
Content 24 Is the subject compelling Does the choice of content match the challenge
Climber is the subject not the rope
The eyes become the subject in this photo and you have successfully isolated them
Nice workmanlike image of a good subject But subject puts you in the middle of the pack
seems to me to be a lil bit off the subject matter hehe
there is a right way and a wrong way to do motion blur this looks like it happened on accident  it would have looked better if you followed your subject with the camera keeping him in focus and the background blurred
no real subject here  much too busy
Dont know why it needed to be validated  I just think you are way too patient to be able to capture this against that brilliant sky  Major issue though is the size would have loved the subject to be bigger but that may not have been possible
I cant pinpoint just exactly why I like this photo so much but its probably her eyes  I get the impression that shes a very strong individual even for one so young  By the way  I personally would much rather see portraits without the cropped top of the head just me but I thought Id mention it  8  Beautiful
You got the type of contrast right Theres a lot of good light here But there is no subject for the eye to focus on here Its just a setting
again very moody and fits the subject beautifully
Definitely meets the challenge and exhibits proper bokeh  The subject matter leaves me wanting not because its a flower  I have nothing against flowers  it just lacks a wow factor for me  Good luck
I already voted now back for comments I gave you an 8 on this shot Lovely colors nice subject and bokeh The very bright whites at the top detract a little as does the blurred purple at the edges of the in focus flower Maybe a different angle could have eliminated this
Good subject and nice shadowing complementing the colours of the ring and rock
This is one awesome photo I love it I am not sure it satisfies the challenge as it does not appear to have one stong subject plus the editing out of what looks like a bridge is a bit distracting Nice photo which should sell well with the editing fixed up
Great photo I love the contrast of subject and background and the sharpness
Great mood and placement of the subject
The subject seem nice but think it could have been better composed and better edited
I already voted now back for comments I gave you a 9 on this shot Lovely vibrant colors crisp detail nice subject and bokeh
I like the framing of this picture as well as the subject matter However the HDR is blown way out for my taste I assume that this was taken in a fully sunny day with a lot of light Id really like to see you take this shot again on a cloudy day to allow a lot more contrast without blowing out the colors
The main subject is isolated nicely
Really nice scene but if the moon is the main subject Id like to see it between branches rather than hiding behind a branch  Just a tiny bit left or right would put it in a space  I really like the shadow effect on the snow
im not sure of the subject in this picture
Subjective  Very punny A fairly obvious pun given the subject of the theme  Reading the photographers comments it appears that not a whole lot went into this yet more may have come out of it than the photographer intended  Had it been titled Light on White some gallery might pick it up for display
Nice shot Interesting subject matter
To me this is a confusing image to look at and the subject is hard to define  However as a bit of an abstract it is well done and technically good  It creates more questions than it answers and it leaves me questioning what the photographer is attempting to communicate  I did not vote in this challenge but probably would have given this a 6 or 7
I like the scene but the subject really gets lost against that wall
Thats certainly a cute subject and puppies dont hold still so I certainly believe it was a tough shot This type of photo usually works best in a vertical format but I do think horizontal was the right choice here It helps to balance the energy that exudes from the subject The bokeh is good here and complements the subject well Focus seems just a bit off but I cant tell if the focus is just in the wrong spot subject moved after focus lock but before shutter activation the depth of field is too shallow or its caused by the subtle compression artifacts Sharpening helps a little but also brings out the jpeg artifacts
An interesting treatment but the overly bland appearance of the subject is uninteresting which is a negative A blend of some artistic and technical aspects it is a good entry into the challenge
 I dont see any main subject in this image
Composition 6 Centered subject isnt too appealing but at least you tilted it and gave it a little energy
Nice frame but the subject gate doesnt bring a lot of vusual interest
a bit busy for my taste  had trouble focusing on the main subject because there was so much going on 
The kid really brings this together  While this image could have stood on its own with the beautiful scenery having an active subject is the icing on the cake  Well done
Hehe  witty title to a good subject well captured This couldve come from a  pet portrait studio  very nice
subject is lost in the darkness
Should be cropped tighter around subject of photo The light coming from the blinds in the upper lefthand corner serves as a distraction
When I look at the picture now I regret I only gave it a 5 My first impression was wrong that it looks an oversaturated image
I thought about marbles on concrete as a subject and was happy to see you chose it as a subject Its a nice marble and the strip of red in it is a great flash of color for this otherwise monotone picture Id like to see it a little more saturated Im not sure the dark and light helps the composition in this photo
I want to know her story You have made me curious evoked my emotions lit your subject very well and kept her nose from breaking her cheekline on the opposite side of the face Looking forward to reading your comments after rollover 
where ever do you get these shotFox are not subject to posing this is wonderful
I bet the set up looked beautiful when it was done  Very pretty choice of subject for the challenge  Love the shades of white and purple in the flower  Looks like good lighting too as nothing seems to be blown out  Nice
nice effort not sure how far you were sitting but if you were a good distance away then this is a very good effort unfortunately I dont think this subject will score well in a FS 6
subject much too far away
I think this would have been so much more a classic portrait without the colored dog toy This desat takes the emphasis off the dog and makes the plastic dog toy the subject of the photo
Darn but Im a sucker for shallow DOF black and white images and quirky subject matter If you have it all I dont stand a chance do I o
good grasp of the subject by the figure on the right The rest seem wonderfull full of wonder that is You got the angle and the eye
Interesting perspective  I think you have got quite a unique subject here that with work can be put to good use
Great subject and title  Im sure you were happy to find these clouds
A veryt compelling effect But  blur There is blur certainly But given the subject matter it doesnt communicate a sense of motion
Lovely panoramic  more than some makes my eye meander back and forth Good subject and perfect crop
An unusual subject matter and an unusual viewpoint of a sad but everyday occurence across Britain Seems a bit tilted and the bright sky tends to pull my eye up and out but I do like the viewpoint 7
Goodness that makes me hungry I might have chosen a simpler plate to put it on though Pretty as that one is it detracts from the subject and makes things look a little busy
Got something odd going on down the bottom left in this not sure what that is THe rail line definitely leads to the the subject and you chose a great angle But the subject is too cramped in the frame compositionally and its focus is not as sharp as it could have been A really fine POV though
I like the subject of the photo but think there is a lot that could be improved about the photo itself  Actually its pretty good how it is now that I look at it  If you made it better it would make it less authentic  This is the kind of quintessentially bad photograph that would show up in some art gallery where people with cheese and wine would chitchat about how technically wonderful it is
There is something I really like about this Not the most interesting subject but its really enhanced by the contrasts The color of the background the sharpness of the foreground Very nice composition
you took an uninteresting subject and made it great best luck its such a good pic
By cropping the top of this image off and making it a square presentation the subject matter becomes more revelant  The branches with the white flowers dominate the scene and add confusion  Wth a hint of them the viewer sees the contrast of rot and decay amongst early spring foliage
good frame but to bad for the reflection in the bottom window that cat would make an interesting subject if it was more visible
The subject is captivating
good positioning of subject
Nicely done fits the challenge to a T The subject is clear but there is still a lot of interest in the rest of the photo The sky seems cloudy as the colors dont really jump out 9
Lighting on the front of the subject would be helpful
The image really should be sharp and full size 640 pixels in one dimension at least it will help you quite a bit It gives the impression that you are making it small to cover up some imperfection in the original image and thats never a good idea
I am not sure how this relates to bokeh It is very hard to use bokeh to enhance our subject with a dark background such as this one Perhaps getting much closer to what you are shooting could be helpful
Nice subject and composition
Usually the eyes are eagerly sought in a portrait however in this case the downward gaze with eye lids covering most of them works so well simply because gaze supports the pensive general expression down to the slightly tightly pursed lips Even a softer background would have been better to maintain attention on the facial feautures While the lighting is not as dramatic as the expression the overall effect meets the challenge well These observations are all minor in comparison to the general insight that this image portrays Bumping up
Use the surrounding space of your subject to create the wow of the photograph
nice lines and way to make the shadows the subject of your photo I also like how the lines of the shadow follow the lines of the stairs in the foreground
nice color But subject needs to be bigger
The skyline is a tad overexposed which distracts and the subject is just plain boring but I guess the title helps explain things
Whats the subject  the fly or he flower
too subtle for some perhaps but not for me  A beautiful subject wise choice to do a self portrait here I love the composition the pose the expression the subtlety  of the beforeafter transition the question of whowhat you are looking at and the pure black negative space  While some suggest going a bit brighter which might also look nice this is fine just as it isreminds me of the old school masters and the dramatic contrast style they favored
A little to over saturated for me but I love the subject matter
I was away during the impression challenge so couldnt vote but would have given this a 9
A beautiful portrait composed and photographed with restraint  I love the way you just sneaked in enough of the reason for your happiness to tell us the story but not enough to steal our attention away from the subject you are the taller one right  7
Interesting angle Why didnt you just put the subject in the upper right third instead of the very top and slightly off center I know you were trying to hide the leash Despite breaking the rules with your composition it is a strong shot with the color DoF and interesting angle
Feels tilted the sun on the subject is a tad too bright fits the challenge as being out of place just not right
hmmmmyour subject lacks interest IMO or I just dont get it
Good subject and location
On my monitor this seems to need a bit more luminosity I love the subject and composition
OK heres where I get a bit confused The subject here is the leaf which stands out strong against the background However you are entering into a challenge on architecture Hence I believe a deeper DoF is needed to have the building a bit more in focus The funny thing about reflections is that you must add more DoF to have them in focus the distance from reflector to what is being reflected is important in your DoF choice
Yes its true the image quality isnt what it should be for an 8 score I thought the same thing myself I am truly surprised by the score Just goes to show you just never know what the voters are going to think and what they will overlook when the subject is right Anyway serves me right now I get to look at this photo of myself every time I go to my profile page 
Beautiful tones and love the subject matter  This is lovely  The crooked lamppost cap really makes this shot me me
Holy smokes  thats a tough shot  Well done  Ive been capturing some dragonflys recently myself  I like the bokeh behind the subject too good complement
Good choice of subject for this and interesting angles to the composition
First given the high luminosity you should have set the ISO to 100 As a general rule your picture will always look better at low iso so increasing iso is the last thing you do
Fascinating  subject and presentation
Not enough of the subject made it into the plane of focus for me Nice background though
Impressive Disjointed almost confusing  youve taken an otherwise uninteresting subject made it nightmarish Well done
without the title it doesnt fit the subject for me 3
I think I would have framed the subject a little more to the left where the subject is looking left out of the frame but I do like the BW and the lighting I like the genune happiness of the subject as well
After three views the point still isnt clear In one sense that in and of itself is not quite right and thus the image meets the challenge subject even if this viewer is too dense to get the concept
Nature never ceases to astound Great job capturing this Im tempted to complain about the bloen highlights but your quirky subject sits in such splendid relief because of it
Very pretty subject and your lighting is excellent  The lines behind her are distracting and seem to be pulling my eyes to them rather than the main subject  Hope this is helpful
The first thing I notice with this picture is the wonderful reds from the sunset  Absolutely gorgeous  However as somebody once commented on one of my photos you do also need to have a subject it is not enough just to photograph the sky  In a challenge with so many wonderful sunsetsunrise pics you would really need to stand out by having an interesting subject and focal point  Here there really is nothing
The mood you created with your processing compliments the subject matter Very pleasant
great eye for an interesting and eye catching subject well suited for this challenge and well photographed really nice work
Even without that I think the subject is not appealing there is too much tree
Some interesting lines and subtle processing but I cant really tell what the subject is The composition keeps bring my eye to the knob by the radiator The drying rack  just doesnt seem to be prominent enough in the scene to be the subject
the black against the pink wall is great but I find the dining room totally distracting   This photo would have been much better with a large expanse of wall behind the subject and maybe just the moulding around the doorway showing or maybe a small piece of art work somewhere to confirm it was indoors
i noticed this site promotes different placement of subject wich is GREAT though sometimes the eye will not go to subject if it is placed wrong i think the frog could be in the frame a bit more so my eye goes right to him there seems to be a lot of blur around him wich can be considered distracting still you did well with this
Work on your subject selection this just isnt very interesting
A good rendition Placing a mask on the subject would have lent this image a greater edge in this challenge 6
I like the processing if your figurine isnt actually made of metal then you did a damn good job of making it look like it is Nice to see a different subject from the norm good clear focus I might have cropped out a little more so as not to cut any of the right arm off
Abstract is art in which the subject is represented by shapes and patterns rather than by a realistic likeness
Why this did not do any better has me puzzled a bit Then Im biased towards a more scenic and general shot in this challenge Something that def did not go down well with the voters who clearly were looking for handwork art rather than photography ar at the very least both
Gives an impression of being massive and imposing
Stunning colors The reflexion is nice also hm the tree doesnt look that interesting to me as the subject of a picture but overall it is nice    7
Nice image of the earing but having a person where the jewelry detracts from the intent to sell the jewelry  Overall this is an excellent photo but it doesnt work as a jewelry ad in my opinion  The details on the model hair freckles and skin overwhelm the subject of the image the earring
Very interesting subject that may have benefitted from a little fill flash but we take these moments when they come regardless of our camera setup
The bW treatment is okay the subject is a bit cramped in the frame
First impression  I liked the slightly out of the box thinking using this subject for this challenge  I can see some may have considered it to be not meeting the challenge but it works for me in that context
I like the way far end is missing from the photo The dash of concrete subject ship actually helps in highlighting the vastness of the environment On the second look I actully find it scary to see the profound nothingness communicated by the photo Bumping from 7first pass to 9during comments Hope this does well for you
Nice photo  Im assuming the subject is the small figure to the bottom left  Quite difficult to see which is unfortunate
I like the central position of the subject though find the bicycle a bit distracting
The image meets the subject matter dead on A sound demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge in a very unusual way A couple of minor detail problems as the image appears to be less than sharp The DOF could have been used more effectively A good solid entry into the challenge
Just not very clean or sharp I almost get the impression that something was photoshopped and photographed
high five to all those who could see past their own egos and voted it fairly even if they objected to the subject matter
Love the sharpness of the subject and the subtlety of the background
Visually stimulating textural subject with sensitive framing
An interesting subject and a nice perspective I dont think the green tone helps the shot though
My overall impression is that this shot shows off the sunglasses more than the jewelry I wish the jewelry had been in focus If this was an ad for the shades I would score it much higher
Beautiful subject and lighting
Just wonderful I love the effect of the subject in middle of all those flowers
Good subject choice I even like the simple setup My only complaint is the lighting Not enough on the rightfront and too harsh on the left
Lovely mood and tones Nice sharp contrast right around the subject while the rest is muted and soft Great photo
If the subject was sharp it would help this pic tremendously
this is an interesting shot I want to like it but im not sure the glitz that the 6 speedlights gives really suits to subject of maternity There is also me wanting more of a defined outline to the subject a hint of under exposure and the fact that i can see the shape of the speedlights and more circular areas of light
I love that pink hue so vibrant and energetic Interesting subject and nice composition this really has some energy to it
Good macro  subject though eludes you the first time you look at it
I think for a sepia challenge the subject should fit in with the sepia nature of the shot Looking at this I cant help but want to see it in colour
Scored you in my top six  This image makes me wish I could be there to see him make a really big splash  You know he is going to do it  I can see the smile from here  Nice choice of subject for this challenge
Although you have met the challenge I dont find this subject interesting to look at
to me the orange doesnt work on such a nice subject
It took me a moment to figure out what it was Interesting subject matter though
oooh gorgeous  there is a slight tilt to the right i think  youd be surprised how a bit of tilt can influence a viewer  it is unsettling and even if it goes unnoticed thes is an uneasy impression that something is wrong  Do you know the measure tool trick in photoshop  Its under the eyedropper  draw a line along a visual that should appear straight here the center tower and its reflection then choose rotate canvas arbitrary  If i rotate our tower 32 degrees clockwise it looks better to me
First look at the image doesnt really tell whats going on here as the subject is not that clear with the angle you chose The title is interesting and attracts the viewer to give it a closer look
Very cool subject for tone mapping
I am sorry to say but this doesnt work for me It is nearly impossible to see any house in this image abandoned or not The main subject should be in focus but not vice versa That is my humble opinion
Good exposure Despite this the subject is barely lit and not very visible  making the  image globally a bit confused
Composition is OK but the subject is boring IMO
I love the unusual take on a childs portrait  Although the subject matter is absolutely adorable Shes not shot in a cutesie way  Excellent
Thanks to all who commented  It is much appreciated  I am very pleased with how this photo turned out  Of course I had a marvelous subject to shoot who seemed to be fascinated by the camera 
This isnt really a subject matter that appeals to me and it makes me think what a waste of rubber However it is a bit interesting and looks like something that ought to be hanging in some teen boys bedroom  I think it could have been improved by cropping out the hairy ankle at the top I like the blue rim if the tire it goes well with the light blue smoke  The focus seems a bit soft  Id also like a little more macadam to the left and bottom of the tire
A very obvious idea which you have pulled off nicely  The bored look on the subjects face adds much to the photo but it is a shame most of the face is hidden by the hand  I think resting the head on the other hand wouldnve worked better  The only other thing is that if there was paint on the subject it would look less staged  Well done
Nice editing Not allowing the subject and foreground  to be a simple silhouette by giving it some light makes your photograph strong
I think a little dodging and burning on a layer may have helped give this subject a little pop  I think its probably a very nice photo but its so dark its hard to tell  The darkness makes it appear a little flat  Hope this is helpful
The red on the cannon really stands out against the grass and wall Nice placement of the subject cannon  I also like the cloudy sky it sets the mood to think of past battles
Kinda dark  Since main subject id looking out of the window it may help to crop out the other person place the red hat person to the right
back for a comment and bump  Beautiful green and the vignette works well  While no main subject to focus on this is pleasant to look at
Your eye seems to go beyond just the visual subject and begins to project emotions in your images  Had to sign on just to comment on this one  Very nice
Yep  I should say the blue angels rattle our windows when they are in town ok off topic airplanes in general are loud  Love that you captured the smoke behind it
I love this great subject and its beautifully photographed Hope it does well for you
A tighter crop on the sign and the interesting building across the street would have made this a great photo The side street pulls the viewers eye away from the main subject and makes the picture seem busy
Interesting image The old and the really old The wide angle effect to the outoffocus area at the top is a bit uncomfortable to look at and the result is that my eye often returns to the subject of the portrait Im intrigued that an image has made me feel that way In that regard youve accomplished more than creating an image
Ahhhh  Terrible focus  Love the composition though Id appreciate it more if you had a small backlight on your subject to bring them out of the black background  As is they sort of get lost in the background and feel flat and two dimentional
i like the contrast between the subject and the background
a powerful image and subject to invoke  Well shot too  I love the grain  I think we need more grain on DPC and I appreciate you using it so well here
Very well chosen subject  one of my faves Love the heavy silhouettes and the soft edges A timeless vibe to this indeed
It would be better to separate the subject from the background to eliminate the distracting shadow Sometimes shadows are good sometimes they arent Interesting shot
Why did you add that strange border to top and bottom I find it very distracting This bridge would have been an interesting subject to paint with light instead of using the flash Also a more symmetric approach would have added to the impact 4
It would have been nicer if the subject was not as dark as his background
Looks like the best focal point is in the sand and Im guessing that you wanted to showcase the flower  plant  Maybe next time compose the image so the subject is more crisp and in focus
Im not a fan of the deadcenter composition although I suspect you probably tried other angles with this subject and they may not have worked that well
Pink at night sailors delight My comment for you though as for a few others in this challenge is that your title indicates the sunset as your subject and the challenge is for negative space to add the wow factor to your subject If your subject were say a small boat in the foreground without the bushes then your bgnegative space would be the sunset and then it works but as your title indicates the sunset IS your subject therefore wheres the neg space I still think you have a nice shot here so it gets a 5
Im sorry but its just not an interesting picture You put the subject dead center didnt use any creative angles or lighting and the ghost itself isnt even an interesting shape Changing any one of those elements would have improved upon this idea Start by looking into the rule of thirds
this is a strange composition the juxtaposition of the oriental carving and the mystic bokeh  here the bokeh is as much the subject as is the carving as opposed to being a subtle enhancer  you are on the right track i just think the image would have been a bit stronger if the dots of light were muted a bit  also the proximity to the carving and the way it fills the left side of the frame also gives a feeling of invasion of personal space as if its too close to me or im too close to it  neither really works well if you are trying to convey a sense of meditation
I like the imagination of the subject matter
This is fun shot  Is that really the right color  Good negative space but the subject seems just eversoslightly and I do mean just slightly out of focus  The highlight on the back of the beetle is a little distracting  Good job  8
Beautiful composition I like the subject matter too
the brightness of the light the paleness of the blues in the water and sky the narrow horizontal crop on the scene the lack of a specific subject to draw us in  it gives this image an unfinished feel
Surrealism express the workings of the subconscious and is characterized by fantastic imagery and incongruous juxtaposition of subject matter   dictionarycom
No clear subject
Congratulations on your ribbon and PB score This was my top pic I actually voted for a change although I must admit my choice was based not only on the excellent execution of the image but also on the subject of the image Ive got a soft spot for chocolate 
Nice texture and sharpness and nice choice of subject for BW conversion
This is a very strong image  The contrasts add a great deal of dimension to this image  It is well balanced clear and fills up the entire image  As a stand alone picture there isnt much wrong with it  I dont see the subject of construction  however  Therefore I cant give you a 10
Nice colors wonderfull view the intended subject abandoned buildings is however not attracting the attention
Very interesting creative effect and use of texture in this one The abstract nature of it is throwing me off though I keep trying to read the text and finding that it doesnt seem to relate to the subject of vodka The highlights in the foil  are drawing my eyes away from the outline
Wow look at those eyes  Great subject  perfect background
What is hidden behind those ingredients Remember it is all about the obscured subject and in this case I cannot make out what it is Defeating the object of photography You may differ from me but this is my humble opinion BTW nice photograph but no vote
An image that demonstates the subject matter of the challenge in spectacular fashion with excellant DOF and color control Both a technical and artistic success that more than adequately meets the challenge subject in particular with the color shades A very worthy contender for top ten honors and a possible ribbon contender
Don this is a great image with a great title  There is no escaping for the eye as it moves along the path towards the raised board sorry I dont know what the subject matter is in the real world but it doesnt matter and hits it with nowhere else to go the blackness of the background being the final touch  I didnt get to vote on this unfortunately only voted on about half the images in this challenge
Raised votecould change later though   good job with subject and light
Good stylistic fit between your subject and type of store you operate Typography works although Id have moved Grandmas Attic down and left just a tiny bit to get it more completely out from under the shadow
Such a beautiful image The subject and background compliment each other perfectly not only with the color being the same but also the way that the bokeh circles in the background match the circles on the ornament and the variations in lightness and darkness within both elements  This cohesiveness makes for a very stunning image  To nitpick I would have prefered even more symmetry to go with the symmetry I have already mentioned the top of the ornament is not perfectly straighton its a horrible nitpick really and I would have enjoyed a square crop for symmetry which would also have gotten rid of the slightly distracting blur on the bottom left of the image  But these as I said are nitpicks which came to mind only because the rest of the image is absolutely perfect
Great idea My first impression is that the gun should be pointing into the space The space on the right doesnt contribute to the picture as it stands
Overall I like the picture but feel like this barely fits the challenge due to the subject being so far away
This looks a bit messy to me and all a bit old rather than new other than the caterpillar  Nothing is sharp here including the subject and sadly not your best work
As for the expression I believe this is both a bit of a language disagreement for those that disagreed that it was a good title and a problem of being a little too subtle which I was going for  While the general meaning I was going for was apprehensive now that I think about it Ive always used the word pensive to apply to this meaning as well a long with most of the people I grew up around  Obviously others feel the same way as well but not everyone does  Lesson learned  She really isnt trying to smile here but was worried because I was trying to get her to have a more natural expression and was busy trying to get ready for gymnastics  I shot off a burst and when I saw this look I knew it was what I had to use   Later on I got her smiling as well and that shot is in my portfolio
Your photo really works  I like the subject so clearly defined and the background doing exactly what it is suppose to do
i would rather see the subject as silhuette or with a fill light  but this is kind of in between
sorry but your photo lacks popyour subject does not draw me in
What a wonderfully interesting photo  The subject intrigues me  smartly dressed with his kindly looking face apparently completing a newspaper crossword and somewhat strangely with a tape measure hanging down inside his jacket  The cornucopia of items suggest this is a secondhand store  so much to look at  A photo to return to again and again
miserably undersung the bright white building behind the subject is like an annunciation I was one of your 9s
The subject works for this shot although the neck looks strained in the angle that it current is and creates a minor distracting element
You succeeded in extract the subject from its surrounds which is very similiar to its fur Good one
Nice macro capture but the subject is a bit cliche
Quite a bit of noise to me and not enough of the subject to hold my interest
I have looked at this one for a while I LOVE the design and feeling of the shot My only nit pik is that the boy is not the subject because of the lack of focus It seems like the gravel is I really like it though 8
I already voted now back for comments I gave you a 9 on this shot Lovely colors crisp detail interesting subject and bokeh
Kudos for subject matter bet this is the only Civil War shot in the bunch  I like the colors composition and fog  Hope this does well
Definitely meets the challenge and exhibits proper bokeh  The subject matter leaves me wanting not because its a plantflower  I have nothing against plantsflowers  it just lacks a wow factor for me  Good luck
I like your selection of subject tree some entries are very uninteresting trees  I would have preferred a stronger use of the rule of 3rds and your light is a little off ie flat  I can see the trees shadow is long so you were very close to the right time for perfect light  On a personal note I would have also liked a bit more saturation in the sky and grass gold and blue would have worked very well Good luck with your entry 6
Theres one thing that bugs me about this shot it looks like youve used the blur tool but only half the tree is blurred Your main subject is very nice and I love the scarey looking clouds
Interesting perspective you cut their feet and their head so no one can get upset about the cropping the rule of thirds works well here as there is no real subject and its well balanced and great use of bw
Too much frame not enough subject
I really love the idea of the piece and the general feel with the matching pastel pinks throughout the image However the turny thing lol sorry I dont know what its called is far too obviously made out of cardboard and that really brings the image down in my opinion I would have made the inside edges smoother or at the very least tried to smooth it out in photoshop Anyways besides that its a great idea and really well executed 6
Its hard to see what the subject is in this photo
Nice choice of subject
The subject doesnt show off the challenge very well Nice bike though
A bit hard to see the subject of the shot the ball at first  the mitt which kinda appears as a blob at first dominates along with the trees to the right
Great potential  What keeps me from voting high is the subject is too small for the macro  Maybe a closer crop would have helped   5
A lovely subject to photograph but unfortunately this is very badly pixelated  It may be a result of resizing for submission or something from processing  You can ask for help after the challenge is over if youre not sure what caused the problem
A lovely subject and set up  It looks like the camera focused on the trees in the background more than the cat in the window  The cat looks grainy and too softly focused in my opinion  Keep trying for future challenges though
Really clever silhouetting and a lovely subject for the challenge My only very small concern is the very bright twinkle just by the birds head which I find distracts me a little
BW is well done but I dont find the subject very interesting
I dont really get a rightangle impression from this one
Well executed closeupmacro  The subject is really interesting and beautiful  The image seems to have a blueish cast but it is a minor distraction  Of course I wasnt there so maybe this is how it looks  Good job and good luck
The challenge is hard as it requires finding Bokeh to compliment the main subject which you have done perfectly The Exposure and colors are also spot on
Nice fish interesting subject
The reflection on the right side of the bottle is distracting and I think in general the color looks a bit washed out
My top pick great DOF for this twisty quirky subject
a bit flat  The main subject is centered and doesnt give an interesting appeal
the subject is well positioned contrasts nicely with the background and it just so happens im a dirtbiking fan if thats a friendrelative i hope they placed well 
A very nice subject because it dominates the image area completely A deeper dof would have helped more I would have shot this at morning and at sunset since it is a very nice structure for this challenge 6
I dont really feel that a single tree is a solid subject here  Having one tree and no others in focus helps but I really feel that the structure on the ground is more the subject
Great subject and the sift foreground frames her really well
While you met the criteria of the challenge this subject is uninteresting and poorly executed  The framed art is too far apart and from the angle of the camera appears to be crooked  If you had taken these frames off of the wall and put them against a more interesting background close together this image would have been better
What a lovely subject and frame  The focus is a little soft  If you use a slower shutter speed with a tripod you could have the trees and rocks in sharp focus while the falls would turn into a misty motion blur
Hmm interesting subject  follhardy but there you go   Id have tried a different POV I think if you saw the boys face and somehow got an impression of the height it woudl be far better  5
Update Okay so its not a sun but a gas flare  The arrangement particularly with the lights in the clouds behind it make it look like a sunset scene however which still leaves me feeling like it doesnt really fit the challenge possibly because I cant get over my first impression now  A title change noting that it is not a sunset might have changed that feeling to a sense of wonder about what exactly is being looked at eg In Africa This Is Not a Sunset  The current title by blending todaytonight actively encourages the misinterpretation as a sunset
At first glance I didnt see it  I thought this has potential but the second subject is underexposed and I just dont see much of interest then it hit me  Brilliant timing and composition  One of my few 10s
Well its a good subject for a still life  You have restored detail in the shadows  Difficult for the viewer and the effectiveness of the scene to look into the sun  That is to look into the direction of the sun
I like the balance of black and white between the subject and the background  The bow adds a nice gray touch with texture
This is a well composed shot Positioning of the moon is great Close to rule of thirds which brings viewers eye back to subject over and over Image is framed well using distances between subjects as I would of done
Perfect blend of subject with environment
Your subject definately looks defeated  Cropping some of the green on the bottom may have brought more attention to your subject
Theres a lot to like in this photo  the stairs the top of the bottle of wine the mood the shine in the earring I do find the object in the bg behind the subject very distracting however This would score a couple of notches higher without that
Very nice subject and good framing and simple background I think the focus is a tad soft thoughor perhaps there needed to be a bit more light reflected onto the dogs face I just feel Id like to see his eyes more clearly Photographing black dogs with dark eyes can pose exposure problems
Excellent framing beautiful colors and a technically perfect  The look on your subject is very fitting with your title something that a lot of people cant ever seem to get right and by a lot of peopleI mean me haha
See yellow flowershooter it is possible to use yellow on the subject  and still retain the white
Dolphinshark figurine The BG top part distracts from the subject though
This image has a subject but could use some sharpness Thats the beauty of Macro Photography to me being able to see textures that ordinarily unnoticed
The rough unfinished look suits the subject perfectly Although many wont here is one who got it Looks like a Norman Rockwell painting This BG is a bit cluttered but I know that is how a construction site is
the subject looks intent or considering  not bored
Nice texture on the birds is the subject on the frame rather than in the frame
I love that you chose a still subject and included a moving background  Excellent and should have scored higher
Not a very appealing subject but nothing wrong with the technique
Great choice of subject for the shot The person has a lot of character and is quite interesting to look at I like the tight close up framing it gives a great chance to show off detail I feel that there are a few factors holding this shot back though For a portrait type shot like this the focus should really be tack sharp on the eyes It seems like here the focal plane is just a little off It looks like the nose mouth area and beard are sharper than the eyes Also lighting wise it is very harsh on the side of his head that whole bright area is blown out And the vignetting thing dont know if it is natural or added in post but for me it just doesnt seem to work for this image
a nice message but looks too posed for my liking I would have preferred if the subject was facing his left not looking right into the lens
seems kinda flat and no real subject  put a big bush or a rock or something in one of the bottom corners
One subject would have worked betterfor me
A very familiar site to many of us and a sure sign of back to school  A nice image for sure but not anything that really grabbed my attention after I got past the familiarity  Given the lack of a specific subject all I am left with is the overall symmetry within the shot which would be fine if you nailed it
A bit overdone on the processing for my taste but expressive and wellcomposed Pity we dont see this beautiful subject more often 
I like the lines and the the contrast but the subject isnt very intersting 5
A very creative look at colored pencils  the image meets the subject matter and with a certain cheeky attitude A terrific demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge Should be a sure bet to win a ribbon or place high as a top twenty image  A couple of minor detail problems not worth mentioning because they dont appear until you really get a critical eye and examine the image closely  Well done
Washed out The vertical lines split the picture in an unfortunate way IMO The subject seems that can not balance the composition The shadows and the spots on the background are distracting
Its a shame the sky is so flat and dull Its a nice subject that needs a little more vibrance  perhaps a boost of contrast would help The foreground starts to far away for me A lower camera position would have helped with that
Well seen  perfect subject for challenge wow is that in shambles
There is a lot of vast spaces for a challenge about people Youve got 3 subject areas going with nothing that really draws your eye to one spot The landscape is lovely however
Great use of negative space here where it is part of the subject of the shot Meets the challenge and technically sound just not any wow for me
Gorgous subject
My first impression is that the scene is a little busy overall The ground up beans that have fallen on the whole beans makes for a very confusing image I took me a few seconds to realize there was a spoon holding the ground beans The spoon is so bright that it merges with the background I agree with the other commenters who said the image could be sharper
Nice picture  I feel the subject should be clearly delineated though
I have a lovehate reaction to this image  On the one hand I love the perspective subject matter and the layers of terrain  On the other hand I wish this was not so desaturated or perhaps split toned  Still love triumphs over hate so I scored it well
A classic good shot In the style of Ben Perhaps not exactly Save for the subject and the sky But a fine photograph
A very pretty subject with lovely colored hair  The yellow in the background is pretty but rather distracting  I would probably have cropped the left side to the beginning of her hair I think this would balance the image better and give the appearance of more room on the right the direction she is facing    I may have also cloned out the little shadow under the nose  Her hair is really beautiful would love to have seen a shot without the hair band as the collar on the black coat already gives a dramatic effect to the shot
Not bad  good impression of heat here
I lie the subject and lines but wont sure about the top prong which I felt was a little lost by the shade and another strand cutting across it
too dark should have just leave the photo in colour the cropping of the image needs improvement eg the right is under cropped while the right is over cropped maybe u were trying to hide something from the photo in that case u sud have crop more on the right anyway i love the subject in the photo 6
for me it isnt an attractive subject though I feel the composition is well done
The intent of allowing multiple captures is to enable such techniques as high dynamic range HDR noise reduction increased DOF etc but not to permit a subject from one scene to be inserted into a different scene nor is it intended to allow a subject to appear in multiple places within a scene
Saturation looks just a bit over high on the carnations  Great subject though and well captured
i feel like the flag pole is distracting  and sorta wish the pic was taken from a little to the right of you possibly nice capture of the essence of cape cod though and new england in spring in general
beautiful colors  I like the softness  It suits the subject
Stunning photo A good subject and so well photographed lying on the ground o Love the pp One of my favs good luck o
Very traditional subject matter  Could you have brought back a little detail in some areas
The gold band border is very unique and jives well with the photo  I usually avoid the subject of borders because they are so subjective so Ill just go on to say great photo  I like how you caught some highlight on the eyelid  Well done
Such a tricky thing to expose these dandelion heads correctly  Youre near perhaps over the edge on being being overexposed in the highlights  From looking at this I get the impression that this image is a crop of something larger  Background is a little noisy and the fluff could be sharper  There is one maybe two others with dandelion heads that are nicely defined and sharp in this challenge  For example  thumb395774thumb
Visual appeal  Yes its there nice subject and a great one at that for the challenge
Compositionally you have done well by having the subject in the left third of the frame  That gives the image both stability and balance  Also it gives the eye somewhere to go
Sometimes placing the subject of your photograph in the dead center of the photo creates a static image  You might try using the rule of thirds for a more dynamic image  Good luck in the challenge
i heard that bathroom windows were flying off the shelves this year  lol at any rate a rather boring subject matter and the picture is rather pixelated looks like it was shot on a cell phone 4
If this were a sky challenge it would win hands down  This is one instance where HDR creating a lasting impression on one hand and detracts from the images impact on the other Additionally the image appears to be just so ever over sharpened  it has that kind of feel to it  I think this might have been better working with one of the HDR images used to produce instead of combining to get the HDR effect
A tad over dramatic IMHO the subject is strong enough that the contrast didnt have to be pushed this far It would have helped to get a bit tighter and loose the tilted stone on the left All that said this is a strong shot  I simply think it might have been stronger
I have a personal weakness in the form of intolerance for tilted horizons To me they give the impression of sloppiness Sometimes a horizon tilted purposefully will improve a photo In this case I dont think it does and its tilted to a minor degree so that I cant tell if its on purpose or an error Otherwise it is a well composed and executed photo Great color Gives a sense of drama
Interestingbut I am having a hard time distinguishing what the central subject is supposed to be My feeling about impressionism is you are able to recognize the subjectit just has a lot of texture and brush strokes
I like this school of photography that revels in what is essentially a banal subject  presenting it in such a fashion that it forces the viewer to reassess its value Interesting work Ben
2 location of subject is odd
cant see the subject in this pictures Best friends do you mean ball and the basketcase
I really like the softness to this image it suits the subject so well
Nice exposure but why use a horizontal crop instead of a vertical or square which would seem to suit the subject better
7 nice subject but the tree in the middle bothers me somehow  it keeps grabbing my attention  and so does the on cut off at the right a little bit
Well done a little too much noise foreground plants they distract from the subject a bit  Regardless great shot 8
Mundane subject made artistic  For me at least this took a few moments to decipher so I loved it when it came together  Certainly a worthy successor to DPCs infamous angry kitty scratch your eyes out photo  A high score from me
I am not so sure but wouldnt it be better if you were  closer to the subject removing the shrubs and bring flowers rather than a flag there is already one on the groundNo offence
The other thing that stands out to me compostion of the photo the subject is centered in the frame and along with the horizon being dead center at all it doesnt give much of a feel of depth nor a strong urge to examine through the photo further
good simple subject
To me this is a little dull its not very sharp nor saturated but I do know that I have a personal bias against pics with a roadpath right down the center of them Im just not generally a fan of the subject I suppose
First impression is that this is more out of focus than soft focused which Im sure is not your intention Maybe you were trying something different from the standard longer exposed image with the banks in focus but the strong water flow pattern However this one might have bee better if youd used the standard technique but then duplicated the layer and applied a strong gaussian blur to the duplicated layer and then reduced the opacity of the blurred layer until it had an overall dreamlike appearance
A unique take on an oft photographed subject  makes for a thoroughly interesting photo  Impresses with the tonemapping  works particularly well for this particular image
The green is a little to bright for me but the subject is pretty and has good detail
Very different but it just isnt working for me  The positive and negative aspects of the image are too distracting from the subject which is supposed to be architecture
The subject appears to be the contrails  Sky a little noisy  Nice overall effect  A 9
Like this concept The nature photographer bound together with nature Flowers are a favorite subject for me so this fits well Overall you did a super job with the flower in front of the face and simulating the background blur There appears to be some yellow color bleeding remaining on top in front of the lost photographers head but a little additional cloning takes care of that A bit more cloning and blur fixes that up just fine
I am not one who favors the use of anothers photo as the sole subject of a photo  Wish that you had included the readers emotion as well
because of the mist the water seems to be the subject rather than the rock
Very hard to capture a great rainbow but you did a good job Unfortunately I must just your photograph on how well you captured you subject silhouette You silhouette are the threes which IMO are not exciting They do a good job of framing the sky I feel the color of the sky is not natural and has excessive noise
No strong subject to look at clouds just werent enough to pull my eyes
Perhaps this isnt the best subject for a bw challenge
main subject is the life saver here not the rope That given the crop at right is too tight otherwise good shot
A fascinating place Looks like the result of a great hike I hate to be critical of this one but there is just so much fine detail that the subject does not stand out well
The angle is normal eye height your subject is dead center of the image no rule of thirds or strong compositional lines the lighting is blown out in the background and still a bit dark in the foreground
Hi IMHO the way you altered the horizon doesnt work well in this picture either by accident or by rotating the picture to give it a little bit of edge The building and trees look just completely unnatural and at least for me that is very distracting Next time try following your subject a little bit panning the blur will make your image interesting without having to play so much with the horizon 
Excellent juxtiposition of sky and subject  the way the clouds spin out from the peak of the roof  Good use of the thirds rule  It seems a bit dark  perhaps a bit more contrast but then again  it is very Icelandic light 8
Hmmmfirst impression was too much processing But its grown on me Absolutely love the tones on the shed and the grass Quite arresting
In my opinion the crop is to wideand not tall enough  I find that your picture is only really about the size of a pinky finger nail lady bug and the rest of the picture is boring or lacking subject body  Keep up the good work and better luck in 2005
Although it meets the challenge overall the subject is not veyr interesting also seems a tad out of focus to me
I love the subject matter Great idea and a beautiful photo
just a little too dark good subject
Large craggy branches make a good source for a darkness challenge entry The partial desat look to this image does not really work that well with this image and the general poor technical quality will hold this score down for it The images seems flat toneless and not in sharp focus
it would be nice if the woman was the main subject of the shot  right now the red bucket jumps out and overwhelms her  nice take on the topic though
I like this image I think you definitely stepped out of the box in finding a unique subject for the challenge Unfortunately it didnt pay off too well in the challenge 
Catch your subject midaction  that means no motion trails
As a busy photographer its always hard to be able to go out and take pictures just for the challenge  Sometime a subject just happens to fit perfectly with what you are doing that week Well done to all that enetered
nice conversion to bw and good subject  but the crop seems wrong square wasnt Westons thing and the shallow DOF does match his style
The body language of your subject is not that of someone in pain   Its more likely he would be trying to withdraw from the world and curled up in a ball good photo technique
Content 24 Is the subject compelling Does the choice of content match the challenge
NikonJeb  This sort of processing not usually my cup of tea  works very well with this subject though
your entire subject is not in the picture
This is a nice image but neither the title nor the subject matter do much to convince me that this is relevant to the challenge topic
I really like the subject of this photo  What I really dont like is the reflection in the showerhead of the photographer
there are lots of swing captures where the subject looks this good but few that capture the background elements so perfectly from suburban dwelling to sun
I like the subject and well done on the exposure here particularly for snow Might have improved it a bit if the dog was a bit more in the left side of the frame and the shadow towards the middle
I like the general idea of this but think I would see it improved with two changes
For the last few months since my membership here DPC I have been learning to look longer at images like this I am trying to learn how to articulate why this type of photo appeals to me and am really have a hard time of it I like this image I like the way it makes me feel  it brings a calming and relaxing feeling almost comfortable I dont know everything thats happening here with either the subject nor the photographer I dont know how or even if this image has been post processed I wish I could better say what it is for me and why    9
i like the capture of the subject and the shadows created
An image that demonstates the subject matter of the challenge in spectacular fashion with excellant DOF and color control Both a technical and artistic success that more than adequately meets the challenge subject in particular with the color shades A very worthy contender for top ten honors and a possible ribbon contender
The shadows hide the main subject of the image detracting from the impact the image might have had
Pretty portrait  makes her skin look smooth The notsopretty wall behind does take away from the subject quite a bit
Im not sure if the fuzzy nature of this image is intentional but I love the abstract aspect of it  I think the title fits the image in general and works for the challenge and I like the blackwhite look  It does strain my eyes a bit because of the blur but overall I really enjoy it  It possibly will be voted down by many but I think theres a good crispness despite the subject appearing blurry and nice tones the abstract nature really gives it oomph so Im giving a 6
Not voting It wasnt until I began looking at this on the laptop which is brighter that I now see that the two girls on the left are laying flowers on a gravestone My first impression upon seeing it on the PC in which both far right and far left are cast in darker shadows was that it was the two girls on the left were playing and excluding the girl to the far right My thought was that the action of excluding the little girl was sad  even though I could not seeread her expression because it is dark and in shadow Now I can see that the two girls are paying respect to a loved one who has passed  the problem still rests in that facial expressions and the tombstone that is flush with the ground are too lost in the shadows to convey a  sense of sadness  there is a touch of sadness but it is hidden by the deep shadows that fall on the opposite sides of the photo right where they need to be visible the most Since this was Advanced editing you could have done a little dodging and brighten up the areas on the girls faces but not too much and a little more on the left side so the graveside is a bit more visible
great subject combining hard and soft lines Bumping up
 Simple subject
This image has a subject but could use some sharpness Thats the beauty of Macro Photography to me being able to see textures that ordinarily unnoticed
Sorry but the subject matter doesnt inspire much or a reaction out of me
colors subject and composition all work well for me Cute shot nice work
Beautiful photo but it does not show a persons defining feature which I believe was the subject of the challenge
My eye kind of wanders around and is not sure what the subject really is The title and composition suggests it is the clouds but those dayglo painted boats keep pulling my eye to the right
beautiful job on framing and the subject is never a tiring one
great landscape but the subject doesnt fill the frame 6
The subject is out of focus
Wonderful capture I like the subject and the posecompositioncrop A little more midtone contrast would help this in my opinion And if I were editing it I might boost the saturation just a little Still well done and Im giving a good score
One of the more genuine expressions in the challenge which I think is one of the most important yet difficult aspects of portrait photography Of course its easier when youre the subject to do that but boy is it hard to trip that shutter sometimes
Im not so sure that cropping or composing a photo so that most of the subject is on the edge of the frame counts a minimalism or not  It does look like a shot where you simply almost missed the subject  Seeing that that is the case by your comments I will just say that it shows
To me The subject is not strong and I  can not see it to well to find where the  start point should be and where my end look should be leading me My eyes seemed to dart all over the place trying to lock in on something specific and it just did not do that here I wanted one place where I can say yep there it is I was all over on this image The softness of image does not bother me I think it was having one thing to stick out to make it pop
compositionally and technically it doesnt stand out but the subject is just out of control
is your subject the white background
Nice idea could use a bit more dramatic lighting The brown table just doesnt work to highlight your subject well
dig the subject and the colours
An interesting choice for meeting the subject challenge  very abstract and different  The image could be a little more dramatic A little more focus would have helped this image score higher A good solid entry into the challenge
Very nice  The edges of the subject to the background are a little jagged  Try blending them a little more
Needed the subject to do something to show action
Great effect very paintinglike I like this style good subject for it
nice specimen but spoilt by general background
Fascinating image Comp color lines light subject and more all combine just right to make it very intriguing
Really poor choice of subject
Title aside I take the subject as the horizontal line of houses
Not an easy subject to capture  Not sure that the bw works think I would prefer this in color
Wonderful portrait  Perfect subject matter considering the World Cup finals are just around the corner
Wow great example of organic geometry  IMHO the image would have been even stronger with even more of the subject in focus
Like the hi key sepia tone and the beautiful subject with all the flowing fabric about her I am distracted by the piles of packages on both sides and the women on the right I think they could have been cropped without losing too much of your subject
My opinion on how you might make this photo better is having the bug the main subject rather than the bugflower as the main subject
My only comment is that for this to truely meet the challenge from my point of view then the subject in the background should also be in focus
I do like the tones but it has an accidental feel and I cant tell what the subject is or how it relates to the theme It takes a lot of practice and certain conditions to pull off a good shot from a moving vehicle
A very creative look at crayons and their use  the image meets the subject matter and with a positive attitude A terrific demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge Should be a sure bet to win a ribbon or place high as a top twenty image  A couple of minor detail problems not worth mentioning because they dont appear until you really get a critical eye and examine the image closely  Well done
I like this You cant really make out the subject well but thats what makes it more interesting The lighting is great and the black background was a good choice By looking at the skin tone I could tell this photo was filtered Liked the idea of that also This photo should of won a ribbon Too bad it didnt
Commenting only I like the grain here the subject is interesting enoughI see a story that shes leaving  I dont personally think the OOF blur is necessary or effective here though especially with such a closeup  Perhaps further back a lensbaby style blur would be interesting to me  Or midway backmaybe motion blurshes leaving
this is a picture that needs a subject
Good depiction of motion while keeping the subject in focus The crop is ok but I feel it could have been better I think in this case a much tighter crop would have worked better I do like the idea with this crop however the break in the trees which produced that white spot is a bit of a distraction If that was all green the crop would work perfectly Just my opinion though
Very cool shot Excellent subject and I love the grain10
rule of thirds for subject anchor 9
nicely donethe subject stands out beautifully and makes me wish for my younger days when i had fleibility like thatgood luck
i wish more was in focus nice job with the subject matter though
A very creative look at crayons the image meets the subject matter and by looking at the simple nature of a child at play A terrific demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge Should be a sure bet to win a ribbon or place high as a top twenty image  A couple of minor detail problems not worth mentioning because they dont appear until you really get a critical eye and examine the image closely  Well done
I knew it was Horn Peak my favorite subject from sw of Westcliffe Great shot and placing  Van
The challenge was to take a photo whose subject is enhanced by the bokeh of the background but the entire photo is blurry and there really is no enhanced subject here  Even if the flowers were to be the subject there are blurred leaves and branches in front of and distracting from it
Good title  thats the impression this made on me when it came up on my monitor  Simple  And I could walk through this field enjoying the fresh air the probably breeze the beauty of the occasional flower
Fantastic stuff Paul  Congrats on the high finish especially considering the subject matter and the proclivity of folks round here to be a bit prudish
motin blur on the subject against a static background thats refreshingly different and the tilt adds to the effect nice composition
On return I see this not as a graphic emulation but a spiritual comparison The subject has nothing in common but who is to say where another finds their freedom Perhaps I am being lose in my interpretation because I happen to like the image
Nothing Ive seen or read since the results of this challenge were announced has changed my mind about my earlier comments  This is a thoughtful  sophisticated composition bokeh for grownups  Alas too many seem to feel that the subject is the star and the bokeh is just a few fuzzy circles  Whereas you clearly see the mood and the context established by the bokeh as the essence of this challenge  But then maybe you have an advantage living in the East
nice capture but i think the subject is the posing doll and not the light i like the emotion though
Very nice photo  It doesnt say groundup to me  Maybe if you had your subject sitting on something and you were on the ground looking up you might have got any interesting perspective  Other than that it really is a nice photo
Excellent shot The converging feathers do a great job of making the subject pop out
Great subject for this challenge  IMO the lighting needs to bring out more detail all the way through the image to look more like a magazine shot
Terrific macro subject needs a crop and better framing imho
A long story here But good photos are subject of good pondering
Youve got an interesting subject with this communications tower but the composition is very static  The subject divides the photo right down the middle this doesnt lead the eye at all  Leading the eye goes a long way towards a more dynamic photo  With a human high up on a pole like that it has the potential to stir up some people if you played with their fear of heightsthere are some different composition possibilities that could easily raise some goose bumps
I like the setting of this photograph it sets itself apart from the others Ive seen thus far in this catagory by showing something that is really worth while to take a photo of This photo may not have a definite subject but the scope and the area shown give it a story 8
Not really getting a feel for Action Shot here  Seems more like Motion Blur or Panning  JMO of course  The arrangement of your subject in the frame is good
Lovely subject but a little too dark
effective use of grain I love the idea but feel the subject doesnt really suit the technique  the skilift spoils it for me has a great turn of the century feel to it
good not overpowering but enough to separate the subject from the background
Needs to be more contrast between the rest of the subject and the sun in the back not just the tip of the head otherwise its not a complete silhouette
Too small is this a thumbnail contest Othewise the compostion is weak even if the subject is bored a 2
Im not sure I like where you placed the sun in your composition  I dont think the sun itself is your subject and its placement makes it a distraction from the other more interesting things going on in the photo
Great capture and the best by far of the many bird shots in the challenge Not usually my favourite subject but this is hard to fault 9 Well done and good luck for the rest of the challenge
I would like to see this with a sepia tone it might suit the subject more but a good picture with lots to capture the eye
 I think the subject is alright for the challenge
I really like the grainy texture in this Its not directly relevant to either the challenge or the subject though Shame because it adds a sort of melancholy mood I think Hmm
Great motion blur while keeping the subject clear Depicts great movement 7
Personally I think that the border is too thick and detracts from your subject
Wow I guess it was difficult to get subject so sharpened at 113 second speed and with a moving subject 
Interesting subject that shows some potential  Where is this mirror and what is its purpose  Did you desat the image in the mirror or is it a trick of the light  Too bad your sky is so blah looking cause I think a nice blue sky would add greatly to this  Centering the mirror in the shot or cropping out further to give more room for a nicely off centered composition would also help considerably  This is definately a good candidate for reshooting
lighting composition subject missing or not focus 7
I like the idea of looking in throught the window but the subject in the window isnt that interesting at least to me  I think the red texture on the wall is great though  I think making that the focus would make for a more interesting pic
Well done on finding a unique subject though
cool subject and composition needs more editing though i think
I like the subject of this picture and the top adds a great splash of colour My only little niggle is that my eyes are led out of the bottom left of the photo  I think theyre looking for the tip of the boot  
I think you found a very strong subject for the leading lines challenge  I really like how the fence takes your eyes to one side of the image then back to the other side to the main subject  A bit more post processing work and this image could have scored in the sixes
good contrast a little more on the subject couldnt of hurt though
For me the subject is too centered not in focus enough and I would like to see her expression to help me feel her excitement or wonder or whatever she was feeling  The lighting seems a bit harsh and I think including more of the beach or the water would help
kinda lose the main subject because the background is so dominant
Quite outstanding Not the most beautiful subject by any means but Im finding beauty in the details Nice job
I am slightly confused by the USM majorly faded comment and not totally sure what this means my first impression was a duplicate layer heavily sharpened and then the layer opacity reduced which is a technique I have used before but Im pretty sure this would not be legal in Basic editing
So not only did you steal my title AND my subject matter but you also had the audacity to get a ribbon out of it
A very clever use of DOF in reverse  it resonates with the impression of romance and history The font is a little small but the color is perfect and matches the mood and overall emotional appear  its not bathetic at all The background is detailed and rich with color even given the darker cast of blue Nicely executed
I  battle with the same problem you do I cant get close up enough and when I do the enlargement away is the sharpness Very good subject and colours I did not enter that is why I can comment freely7
The score received is generally related to the connection the average viewer makes with the subject They do not have to like the subject but they do have to find a basis of understanding The rebelliosness of youth will not be enough for most DPCers to relate to this image You probably accept that and dont expect it to get a high score
Back ground in general the blue background would have worked fine However for the Brokeh challenge I would have used a more intricate back ground to show the oof and blur better Perhaps placing a guitar in the background sitting about neck llevel would have worked nice The other part That looks ackward in this shot is the fur that the guitars are setting on It just does not seem to have a compatable feel with the smooth glass guitars I think placing them on a large mirror would have looked wonderfull
same subject as mine i took baby powder thought and i didnt say it was fake Well nice pic
Natural patterns are interesting and fall into the subject area
nice but I would take that subject as being horizontal just as your shot is
Great shot  Good framing and unusual subject matter7
Beauty is a subjective thing I know  In my scoring and comments Im trying to score based on NOT whether or not I would think a particular subject beautiful but on whether the photographer has succeeded in creating a beautiful photo  I look for the elements of color lines focus and dof interest lighting  and a certain element of grace and lovlieness   Im looking for a unique and creative  appeal for the highest scorers  The description says to create a photo that makes the viewer think thats beautiful so it will undoubtedly be very subjective   This is what Im putting at the start of all of my comments  and I hope it is helpful
Great individual elements Not sure what the subject is though
Overall this is an subject that makes carlovers go Ooooh Im sure I would have stopped to look it over if I were passing by But what I wish is that images of cars would make me see the Ooooh when I look at them Capture the feeling you get when you find a sexy Vette and then youll have something impressive
Good picture of a grisly subject
I think that the door lines down the thirds works well  but also the way that the face is angled creates a leading line through the side of the pictura  The eyes are great  in that they force you to remain in touch with the subject  it ensures a second look
very creative i wouldve liked it more if the musical notes were cut from templates but i get that the subject may have helped create them
great texture and tones intriguing subject
Neat  The subject is to small for me and it is not really a silhouette per say  Due to its size it is hard to judge many things about this photo  better cropping or being closer to the subject would work better for me  Focus needs to be worked on so at least something is sharp  The fog effect is a nice touch the overall mood of the photo is great as well 5
Seems like an interesting subject but the lightning is very hard and I think this could have been better composed
Congratulations Kris  Was the subject hanging there and balancing the stool with hisher feet
I think you should pick a subject that you can properly edit  This needs some serious perspective correction that you cant do for this contest  I hope you shot this loose so you dont have to lose half the tree on the left when you correct it  good luck
I like how the subject is in the corner but I think there is  negative space  or at least not the right negative space  could have been better had you for example been on a hill with a simple bg just grass and sky
However the subject isnt obviously falling up  I think the key word is obvious  Most voters spend much less than a minute per image  The story has to be told either qucikly or in a dramatic fashion so as to hold th interest untill the teller if finished  He looks like he is doing a flip or falling down  His body language head positon all are responding to normal gravity  So though the title says falling up to many voters saw falling down and some may never have even read the title
It is a great moment the bee appears not focusedi would personally crop it closer to the subject as the green appear a bit distracting
An interesting choice for meeting the subject challenge  very abstract and different  The image could be a little more dramatic A little more focus would have helped this image score higher A good solid entry into the challenge
For some reason this looks obscene lol Very well lit and exposed I cant think of a single thing to say to improve this shot Technically or even subject choice There just happens to be some great wow shots out there imo
Too harsh lighting subject not in focus enough
Obviously the subject is the Space Needlenot the land
subject in rule of thirds to anchor image 9
Classic Ubique the subject contrasts here are brilliant
A lovely subject and I like that there are people in the scene showing that its alive
The subject matter here just doesnt have any real appeal for me
Nice capture of the fancoach The white shirt of the player pulls your eye away from your subject
very cool  almost an unfair use of subject matter but you brought something to it  the scientist in me is measuring windspeed
Nice highlighting of the subject in this it sits proud of the darker background
what an interesting subject for an image  i bet it can look great at just any time of day  hope youre getting some good comments and suggestions and this youre not getting overlooked in this monster challenge  good luck
Youve managed to make an unappealing subject into a beautiful piece of art with your processing and composition  One wonders why the man is lying on the wall what was he thinking when he bought those speedos
two different oils Good subject matter The shots really clear you see every detail in the movement of the oil
Let me start with what I like about your image1st of all subject matter You lucked out and got an excellent subject Subject can make or break an image Next I love the vivid colors That is both good and bad for this image
stunningnot sure if this will be viewed as rural by everyone but it certainly works for methe light composition crispness subject matter action are amazing Has to be 10 from megood luck and maybe congrats on the ribbon in advance
I didnt vote but understand your frustration at the low placing I think as youve guessed it was possibly more to do with the subject not being that exciting theres not really anything to draw the viewer into the image and linger for longer Better luck next time
Beautiful shot the subject is nice and sharp and the neg space really makes it pop
I found this image interesting  The subject is boring but the composition makes up for it as does the focus and POV Well done crop I think this is probably the best of the powerlines images 8
subject looks greatbackground is perhaps too in focus  Eyes are drawn immediately to the parking lot not the rock formationmaybe some cropping is in order
I awarded nine 9s in this challenge but only one 10  to your photo  Although the subject is a bit too DPC clich for me I dont see a single aspect that needs improvment  Congratulations Jaime
Nice subject and pose The left foot is missing Im not keen on the sepia  was the colour version that bad
the subject is too far away maybe with a better crop putting them on a third point
Sharp subject with nice color contrast
I understand that fixing the tilt of the horizon would have made the palms look even more inclinedI really do not see anything interesting as a subject here
cool picture Main subject is very central
I like the pattern of the lines that are plaid like Unfortunatly power lines are a popular subject so it seems a little drab when compared
A good percentage of the image isout of focus  By the largeness of the outter circle it appears that THAT would be the main subject and therefor would seem that that part should be in focus  I realize that you were shooting for the center to be the main subject but it just doesnt come across that way to me  The lighting is harsh  Reflections in the CD are very distracting and the large white reflection at the top is blown outwhite  The center circle doesnt appears to be not in the center of the CD making this look like a quick kind of shot  The centered composition isnt very visually appealing and the greyish kind of background doesnt really acentuate the subject very well  I hope this doesnt come across as too harsh but in the same respect I hope it helps you out in your further photography  Heather
lighting subject missing 8
Texture in the natural world an image that demonstates the subject matter of the challenge in spectacular fashion with excellant DOF and color control Both a technical and artistic success that more than adequately meets the challenge subject in particular with the color shades A very worthy contender for top ten honors and a possible ribbon contender
I guess more of the subject would help
good but not great capture of subject
This is one tricky photoI must say I almoust voted on it like blured which depending on subject is 12 Only at last moment I noticed your idea and had to return to change my vote Sill I think you could have improved your composition I would keep just half of gutter and maybe more space on right side to emphasize your object Or to capture snail in front but from lower level and seeing gutter behind the snail I wish you good luck the challenge is to see the snail Maybe should have gave hint in title
beautiful colors nice subject
Maybe a tad to bright but in general I like it
I like your subject choice and you had very good light for shooting but the first thing I see when this shows up on my screen is the processing  The blur and vignetting done to isolate your subject has instead nearly become the subject
Why does it look like only the main subject was tonemapped Everything else looks naturally processed
Keystoning here really hurts the effect  Just a bit of correction and a touch more saturation here while making those dingy whites brighter would have really made this a true top contender   Great subject matter awesome find
Looks a bit over something maybe sharp or contrast but great subject matter and crop
great subject  poor photo
Would I change anything  Totally minor but I may have moved the chalk just a bit to the left so it doesnt interfere with the 1  Other than that I think you did about as well with the image as you could  The only problem is its general lack of wow  On DPC wow gets you to the higher scores  You can see this by the vast majority of votes being 5 or 6  People give those votes to picture which are technically well done but dont quite hold their attention long enough to get higher
The short definition of Bokeh from KenRockwellcom which I am using for voting on this challenge Bokeh describes the rendition of outoffocus points of light Present  Is the subject enhanced by the bokeh of the background Yes Very creative shot Cant imagine how many tries it took
beautiful subject
Beautiful subject with a nice simple composition But the whites arent quite bright or white enough
this is a cool image  Im glad that you found a way to get the girl as more of a focal subject then the white lamp  howed you get it that white anyway
Though technically lacking high noise near hot spots white balance off I like the capture of your subject in its relation to the challenge theme  Focus imo should be on the eyes and not on the nose  Looks to be perspective distortion as well maybe from using a wide angle too close to the subject
I dont like the glitter or dirt of whatever it is all over the hand great job getting your subject to stay there though
For the people who have doubts about the age of this tree the location is at nearly 6000 feet so one would expect a slow growth and it made an old impression on me How it is possible to guess the trunk diameter without a reference is beyond me it was certainly more than 14 inches
Good subject and composition Image is not in the high contrast style of Adams but it is really the overall focus of the image that is its main issue It seems both oversharpened and out of focus at the same time This is common with digital landscapes  I know I take landscapes all the time and all mine are like that It is probably the cameras internal processor doing it to you
I like the repetition of folded petals  It makes for the impression that its petals go on and on I wish for just a little more light on the yellow though
Never hurts to have a great subject
I do like how the subject and background mix
Overall a good photograph but the subject in its position and light not powerful enough to pull out a high score When taking a photograph make sure your subject is more powerful than the environment around him IMO Keep up the good work This may have not been your best work or best score but you have room for improvement and I believe you will Keep at it because your shot was good It just need those things that take a picture over the top
Great subject for this challenge  Love the soft curves of the wavelets
great subject for this effect it reminds me of soviet propaganda or art or both
very gritty but unappealing subject and frame  It just doesnt work for me sorry
Very cool Awesome journalistic shot The expression on the guys face captures my impression of airports The woman walking adds a great second point of interest and the customer at the booth isnt a distraction though it could have been Very stunning
Great lighting and also very nice subject 
Nice shot Seems like tower is leaning though You might also try using a polarizing filter on your lensif you dont already it would make your sky a darker blue and make your subject stand out more
The yellow petals are captured beautifully I am a little confused on a challenge called pink that the main subject and title are yellow
Colors are fantastic in this shot Normally the subject looks better if it isnt dead center but here it works well Nice job
Very nice to see this clothespin I think this image would be stronger if the DOF was wider to show the detail of the subject a bit more
The minor shadows on the right and left of the subject that show on the background netting will yield a higher score for this image if they were even
Surely Zen I love your choice of bright small subject and large colorless background I just wish the lighting was a little better on teapot maybe a little warme Hope this does well for you8
Nice The cactus is a strong silhouette subject though I find the rest of the foreground silhouette a bit messy scrappy  doesnt quite work for me in terms of composition balance Great strong colours in that sky though
I wish this were a little brighter the top of the pic seems so much darker than the bottom Cool subject and nice angle but a very simple pic
Great saturation levels it must have been hard not to contrast and sat up this image but youve done a great job keeping it pure  Very interesting subject and excellent DOF Best of luck 8
I do like that the subject is not directly in the center of the photo  That I think was a plus for this image  Although Im not sure what was outside the photo on the top I assume that it was better cropped the way you have cropped it  However I think one commenter mentioned the blue color at the bottom as being distracting and Im going to have to agree  With all the negative space at the bottom my eyes want to see it all one solid color  The only way it would work is if the blue tied in with the subject somehow to help enhance it but I dont feel that the blue adds anything to the photo as is  At this point it is just a distraction  Not sure cropping it out would work though since then it would be almost panoramic  So I think the only reasonable solution there would be to reshoot and make sure that blue light wasnt there  Cover it up maybe  Put something over top of it
This is great Original and good subject matter  Nice use of black and white
Beautiful reflection in the water  Obsolete subject kind of vague IMO
Awesome  Great shot editing and the subject matter is fun as well
even though this thing has done at DPC a lot recently subject arrangement and the diagonal composition are very appealing here
Great job  A very nice subject matter and it had a lot of potential however the colors in this seem a little washed out  I do appreciate you meeting the challenge without leaving me to have to figure out how you met the theme
Liked the browns and golds and the bokeh  Thought the subject was a too centered
Im not sure about the texture seem to hide the subject too much
Ill credit you for finding something that isnt gold  But the subject and composition dont really grab me
I am sorry but the subject just doesnt appeal to me
dark and needa more contrast to bring out subject
Image is too small  You should take advantage of the full 640 pixels length or width  Your subject is obscure I cant tell whether it is a sheet pile of sand or a part of a sculpture
The bug comes across as the subject instead of the water bottle
Head in hands again still the balance is great and the subject looks very bored an 8
i think a tighter crop on the sign would have been intresting the blurred people are distracting to the subject
Good job isolating your subject and your use of leading lines and diagonals works well  Lighting is great as well
Clever playfulness with the title and subject matter  Beautiful lighting and complimentary texture  Good luck This would ribbon if I had my way
Good I like this Youve reduced the necessary information used to portray your subject to an absolute minimum I would say The concentric pattern of the light is key and that pin is clear although its nothing more than pure black and white strong compositionally also  feels like youve paid attention to the fine details all of which stuff I would suggest is requiite for minimalism
Like the way the subject is centralised and the symmetry
Portraits are my least favorite subject matterbut this one is wonderful  The skin tones and lighting look so natural and untouched not oversaturatedetc and the photo is so simpleyet not boring  Even betterit fits the challenge  One of my top picks  Good luck
out of focus badly lit subject looks like hed rather be elsewhere
The best of the needle and thread images in this challenge  This is a really tough subject to do well Good focus and lighting  There seems to be a bit of noise in the image but maybe that is just the texture on the needle  Good effort  6 from me
Perceived as too common a subject in general squirrel perhaps  Hmmm  This is a wonderfully executed shot  Simple subject  Well defined foreground subject and background  well focused etc
I cant tell if this is real or staged The reflections in the glass gives the impression that it might be the latter but it wouldnt surprise me if someone would fire off a 9mm in their own living room P
i dont know what is the main subject here its either the building or the tree
The vase and flowers does come across as the subject of the piece  Which probably cost you some points  Curtains are completely blown out at the right of the picture losing all detail  Since the rest of the picture is darker in comparison the eye keeps going to the featureless white space
The white speckles are disconcerting but neat image  Positioning of the subject could have been at more of an angle  this feels a little flat for all its prettiness 7
Seems over exposed  I was more interested in the sign than the dog which should have been the subject of the shot
Beautiful purples  the subject doesnt help illustrate the challenge however
very professional looking shot very much like its straight out of the brochure  it having the model number on the number plate just adds to the overall polished impression got a mate who works for volvo  the composition is good in that it gives equal billing to the car and the landscape though one gets the sneaking suspicion i would like to have the car at a more 34 view  and like any good volvo its good to see that it has its headlights on even in broad daylight  a good take on a familiar kind of promotional car shot  8
now that is very different nice Macro and tonal range of a simple subject matter
Sure is grainie and lack of clear focus maybe that was your intent but hurts the subject matter in my opinion
A very creative look at colored pencils and crayons  the image meets the subject matter and with a different attitude A terrific demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge A couple of minor detail problems not worth mentioning because they dont appear until you really get a critical eye and examine the image closely  Well done
good postion of subject kid shots do all the work trow some water in and you have a classic
I think it wouldnt have made such a difference if the sky behind it wasnt so bright but it just makes the subject hard to look at
A lovely simplecomplex photograph  I imagine this to inhabit that sacred ground between a candid and a posed portrait  Im sure the photographer does not know the man and yet its not a stolen moment like most street photographs  Instead its a moment the man sees the photographer there is an instant of unspoken communication and then an instant of shared salute each to the other  Exactly the thing that makes photography a matter of connection  between photographer and subject between photographer and viewer and most magically of all between subject and viewer  The man knows hes going to be looked at by people he will never know and he salutes them even more than he salutes the person with the camera  So its a oneofakind moment never to be repeated  9
Good The subject stands in the forefront contemplating and the hustle  bustle near yet far Sets him apart
Its a bit too soft for my taste though I like the centered comp with the flower and the square crop Different subject would have done better with the softness perhaps
Well a great subject tortoise by the way and it is framed Light looks a little weak and flat so shooting earlier or later in the day would help make definition more interesting
That is an awesome picture and the bw really does it well Chrome is a very difficult subject to do well I like the tight composition and do think it might make a neat print
Wow  Now THIS is awesome  Cant wait to read the story behind this photo  I hope I dont find NA in your subject line  Theres got to be an explanation    Fantastic photo  10
Definitely meets the challenge and exhibits proper bokeh  The subject matter leaves me wanting not because its a flower  I have nothing against flowers  it just lacks a wow factor for me  The image in the background is intriguing but not really adding to the image IMO Good luck
Very crisp For a relatively uninteresting subject bird this one has a unique quality about it The crop and the texture on the chain link fence make this shot appealing Super job
The pose of your subject looks terribly unnatural and even painful to me
Amazing That you can capture this is just that And the subject is wonderful too A little more depth in the blacks would be just great here but its still lovely
The face of the main subject is just a black blob  I think the exposure isnt right
What a sweet success  Love the goldness in this and I find the red rose a very good subject here in toning down the glaring brightness of the gold especially after you look too long at the highlights on the letter blocks
I can tell what is the subject in the photo and the title doesnt help I guess I dont get it
Wow awesome choice of subject for this challenge
This is the kind of silhouette I like there are some details on the subject but not enough to say it is not a silhouette I also like the mood
Nice subject and angle however not helped by the really small DOF
Im not a huge fan of the subject matter but the blurred paper a the bottom er no pun intended alone is worth an increase in score from me
i think that this photo fits the challenge perfectly  the child is the subject of the photo takes up a small portion of the image space and unlike many others that i have seen he is the STRONG point of the image  i may have played around with the colors a little bit more because everything seems a bit blue and underexposed  8
doesnt fit the subject for me but great photo
PS Also the subject is so beautiful God Bless
Very nicely captured photograph with a very unique subject matter Lovely colors and excellent use of lighting 8
First of all let me say that I love the composition color facial expression lighting and the general soft feel Its a beautiful expressive image
I like the picture and have come back to vote on it several times I didnt understand the name until now I would have liked it better the main subject was the deer and the head stones were the background 8
Interesting subject but nothing is opening Score 3
I thought your subject matter was great the lighting was spot on and the composition worked well I scored it a 7
I would have like for this to be a little larger so I could read the names or perhaps a closer crop  I love the red flowers though that ad some interest  Also the fence really takes the eyes away from the subject and leads them right off the page  Im not really sure how you could have composed this shot to avoid those things but maybe an angle from above and left of the memorial that would include just a little of the flowers  Anyway these are just my opinions and it doesnt mean the photo is bad in any way just some thoughts
Good candid shot I Love how the subject is in focus but everyone else is blurred
This would be a fantastic perfect shot has the subject been in sharp focus love the color
ugh Technically nice but subject wise its unappealing
Kinda cute but too many things going on in this composition Viewers have a hard time deciding if the subject is the fence the horse the tree or the vehicle
nice idea great creativity on subject matter
You are able to draw the attention to you subject very well by a good placement and the backgroung being mostly black the only thing that distracts me is the blown out sky the image would look much better if you crop the top part IMO
Interesting subject choice
Very pretty shot The soft focusblurring might be getting very close to too much but it does work well in general with this image
Good subject and the glass is beautiful but this image doesnt compare well with other beautiful subjects  I like the background but the top of the piano isnt in focus and there are too many blown out parts from the flash  Keep trying and you will do better in the future
Very nice  You have done a great job of contrasting the subject with the blurred backgroundclearly difficult based on the majority of pics in this challenge  Great job
I like the soft blending nonjarring of the subject with the background  Smoothness contrasted with texture appropriately  scaled for the background  YEA
The short definition of Bokeh from KenRockwellcom which I am using for voting on this challenge Bokeh describes the rendition of outoffocus points of light Definitely present Is the subject enhanced by the bokeh of the background Yes indeed Similar to my own shot So of course I score this highly 
Use the surrounding space of your subject to create the wow of the photograph
Good general texture and interesting angle
fantastic shot  Incredible subject and composition  10
Nice post production and a modern subject that lends itself well to the impressionist treatment The shadow leading to the bowl is a distraction and the placement of the bowl in the central axis detracts from making it an excellent work Nice colours and tonal range all in all well worth the 8
just a great subject  and fun creative interpretation
Not sure this conveys the challenge subject all that well but what a friggin killer picture
Lets start around a 55 image  Thats a good place because it is an image with promise that let us down  I see you were hoping for more on this one too  The choice of subject is good  A very interesting building  Your composition is at least not straight on but it is a bit static in that there is little or no context for us sometimes that cant be helped and I dont know whats there that I cant see  The HDR is a good choice because it allowed you to keep detail in the sky BUT I see two problems  One and Im pretty sure you know this now your colors are crazy  Im all about saturated colors but not when they look unnatural  Weve hit that point here  Two the clouds in the sky are too lopsided  You have half a blue sky and half with clouds  I think that generally degrades the image and sometimes you just have to sit and wait until you get a better balance
Hmm its hard to tell what the subject is
Spot on as far as subject matterwould like to see better ligthing but very cool find
10 Love the subject and light
At firsty glance I didnt realize the subject was OUTSIDE Creepy
Did not rate this one very highly sorry  Technically just not very sharp resolution not very good and lots of grain  Compositionwise juxtaposition of the dark subject on the light background is good but of the dirty blanket is a turnoff
Sweet  Great subject for 1 sec  Well executed too
I like this type of art   it makes a great stock photo for environmentalist uses and it also fits well with any prehistoric theme  I love the coloring and the sharpness in the subject and the background  The border is perfect for cleaning up the edges without taking away from the picture  9
Hi Key works well with the subject here
This is also true this was very thoughtful composition It follows almost everything of a good composition Keeping things simple accentuate the subject matter And say what we wish to say easily The viewer does not have to put hisher mind and can enjoy the beauty and the message behind
An extraordinarily difficult subject and composition I hate taking shots of white birds even less in sunlight and cant imagine trying to capture one in flight An amazing capture Im sure itll be underappreciated so just allow me to state how thoroughly impressed I am with this image 8
Compositionally I like how the subject is in the right side of the frame and how you have used a clean black for negative space  A couple of different things could have been done to make it a bit more dynamic though  From the higher angle it looks like she is looking down on the flowers which is nice however the angle itself is rather stale  Higher might give it more of a dramatic feeling or lower to show more of the detail of its face   If you really like this angle I think zooming in and cropping it very very close
The image meets the subject matter dead on A sound demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge in a very unusual way A couple of minor detail problems as the image appears to be over sharpened but that may be a lighting artifact The DOF could have been used more effectively A good solid entry into the challenge
I like your backgrounds contrast with the subject
An old rusted pump like this has seen some stuff in his days  he has a story to tell and i felt you missed the opportunity to capitalise on the intrigue of the subject matter
very creative  I would like it more if the main subject was totally in focus  I also find that the glasses on the person on the left is a bit distracting  full marks for creative though 7
Again I have said this before the simplicity of the image is what made this one good for me  Great photo nice detail  I gave it an 8 probably would have gone higher if there was a little bit more subject to keep my attention longer
An excellent choice of subject for this challenge and very characteristic BW processing Fits the challenge well 8
I already voted now back for comments I gave you a 9 on this shot Lovely colors crisp detail nice subject and bokeh
Good job thinking outside the box but a generally uninteresting subject matter all things considered
Beauty is a subjective thing I know  In my scoring and comments Im trying to score based on NOT whether or not I would think a particular subject beautiful but on whether the photographer has succeeded in creating a beautiful photo  I look for the elements of color lines focus and dof interest lighting  and a certain element of grace and lovlieness   Im looking for a unique and creative  appeal for the highest scorers  The description says to create a photo that makes the viewer think thats beautiful so it will undoubtedly be very subjective   This is what Im putting at the start of all of my comments  and I hope it is helpful
interesting subject
i like thismade me wonder what subject is thinkinggreat colorcontraststraight to muh favs 9
I was looking for a much lighter subject
It was clearly the ghastly horror of this concept that scared voters too much to rate it highly Evokes WAY too much negative emotion My ifrst impression was Oh my God What if that happened to me shudder
Well your subject has its own wonderful arrangement of shape  form  the light is creating some intriguing shadows  I like the difference in the headlights  the windshield  most of all I like that almostwhite plain sky  the level camera angle
Uncomfortably the subject is the only thing that ISNT blue
Great subject idea I love the halfeaten Oreo and the crumbs
Unfortunately it looks as though your subject was looking almost straight into the sun  It looks as though this had two effects She could not keep her eyes open very much and the right side of her body is completely blown out  An interesting photo though
Great Stop motion P I see the fire I see the drink and I see the thing making the splash in the glass But I dont know what I am supposed to be focusing on I wish the fire was the main subject of this image Cool effect idea not that great of an execution 5

Subject missing or not main subject 9
Dang it I missed the figure when voting  Now Im mad at myself  Not sure I would have scored it higher  cant really award points for carving  OK maybe one or two more for creativity in subject matter  I feel completely different when I look at the image now  I liked the textures and lighting and tones before but this is  much more interesting with that subtle ephemeral figure
The chairs and table disappear into the detailed wall  the eye has to search around to find the subject instead of being immediately attracted to it Given its rather bland color obscured positioning the subject fails to attract an interest
I assume this is yours Jeff unless someone is stalking you at work  Looks like this staircase works well for you  My only complaint is that Ive seen it several times before  Dont get me wrong if I ever find a subject that consistently scores well Ill keep using it too
This wouldve been more exciting if there was a subject to go with the photo
treatment suits the subject
you took my pic thats what lol nice subject matter The photo has the feel of a seventies porn the color contrast of older film
You know Im kinda new to photographythis rule of thirds thingto me it seems like the subject is not quite what I understand the rule to bebutwith the reflectionit brings the subject to center of a third Im not sure if thats what the challenge was But its a great photo  focus color and lighting Im sure youll get bonus points for the model  Ill give it an 8 because I think could be tilted to the right ever so slightly
I like the atmosphere rendered by the subject and light blur mist like Im not crazy about the composition it would be cool to see recropped whith rule of third on the light
I like the grunge effect that serves this subject to a T
Take a photo of something but only HALF of your subject can be visible in the photo
Lovely old specimen  Nice choice of subject for monochrome well composed
Nice tall feeling here The effect isnt gonna go over well with these voters im thinking  The subject is abstract and interesting on its own i would think though
This is really good the subject is so intersting and then its set against a really interesting sky
A very unique way to meet the challenge subject  well done
Im having a hard time with this because Ive voted other photos with the main subject in focus as not abstract I really like this though But Ive been using the definition Of relating to or being a style of art in which natural objects are not represented realistically Sorry I cant go higher than a 6 if I think that it does not meet the challenge I hope a 6 doesnt hurt your score because I do like the picture
Your subject the building isnt all that interesting to me
To me this is an unusually good picture of a child subject  a candid portrait wellcomposed and not contrived and without the feeling that Mommy or Daddy has coaxed the kid to look cute Well done
Youll always get extra credit points from me when veterans are a subject  This is a great shot and I really like howt he clouds seem to swirl around the memorial
Im not sure about the coloring its a warm color and I think of metal as cool but it IS a very different  original subject choice
Well you did a good one here thats for sure  Your model has a huge impression on my eye  His posture his glare glasses and exposure are very exquisite  Rather you did that or the model my compliments abound  The lighting is fabulous great job  One of my top choices for the challenge
i think what would make this better is that your subject be more in focus It seems very soft Your eyes are really done well and colors look good
I love the way you have taken a very simple subject and made it a really neat picture because of the lighting and colors
great find for a subject and great lighting I do not like the composition however If you were going for a profile shot the angle is a bit off I still give it a 7
I would have avoided the parking lot  The trees and the sky offer great subject matter for Ansel
Entirely too cute  But oh what a serious look your subject has  Timothys comment is quite appropriate
Sorry subject matter not a lot of appeal looks out of focus
I have to agree that I suspected this wouldnt do great here but 51 is a terrible score for this shot Its getting dangerously closed minded here at DPC and its incredibly frustrating I cant believe that theres comments about the subject being out of focus sigh
Now heres something interesting i would prefer a tad more  sharpness but the subject and distant background as well as the coincidentally touching objects make this special    that is the moon right
Awesome shot in my top five  What a fantastic subject she is
looks like subject is out of focus unless you wanted to show the motion of the wall
I like the general balance of the composition but wonder whetherthe lamp on the right creates too much glare behind the drummer
Use the surrounding space of your subject to create the wow of the photograph
A very creative look at crayons  the image meets the subject matter dead on with subtle yet detailed effect A terrific demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge in a very unusual way Should be a sure bet to win a ribbon or place high as a top twenty image  A couple of minor detail problems not worth mentioning because they dont appear until you really get a critical eye and examine the image closely  Well done
Games puzzles and the like are interesting to me  I recall a cousin of mine spending hours fascinated playing with his Rubix cube  So for me the subject is not a good fit for the challenge
The subject matter is ok The sky is too bright Lighting is a bit harsh for the scene An ok shot but nothing magical
wheres the shadow looks like the lightning is the main subject here
Sorry this doesnt work for me I dont find it beautiful its not because of the soft focus just the subject
Ouch  That hurts my eyes  The fire is SO bright    This subject is interesting but to get a 30 second exposure on this you would need to use some heavy ND filters to keep from getting the blowout  Good luck in the challenge
great perspective not too extreme unless anything outside of 5 feet is out of his range  if so tell the subject to stick to the lane and shy away from the 3pointers
Aptly titled Feels a little busy to me  my eye cant decide what the subject is Maybe thats okay
Im not really big on the saturated purplepink yet this really works for me  Your subject does indeed seem to be expressing herself and having a grand time  Subtle vignette works great
Beautiful shot Photographers and their big equipment offen makes the best subject 
Yup its separated fairly well executed I feel that this could have used less shadows and a little more detail As for the subject its a little bland IMO Perhaps if this had been shot on a different color back groung it might have been more astheticly pleasing as is seems pretty average
I start out seeing the background  I think no problem Ill just look at the bit thats in focus  Then I look some more  Aha  I think the subject blade of grass is in focus   But its not  Then that tiny little drop in the center of the picture is in focus surely   But its not   Then I start to wish the photographer had just let the drop fall and gotten everything out of focus
Nice view but too busy to do justice to the subject A Single Tree
a good slant on the subject
A lovely scene with a subject other than shadows as the main feature
Setup symetry and balance The photo usualy tends to look better if the subject of the photo is close to the center of the shot In this picture it is slightly offset to the leftMy eyes are forced to fight between the tree trung and the nest There is no smooth flow between the two different subjects I also feel that if this had been shot a little closer up it would have alowed the veiwer the opportunity to see and enjoy all of the intracate layers that the nest are made of This would have not only given this shot a bit more intrest but would have also added a sense of danger to the shot as well
I enjoy subject matter like this A seemingly mundane and ignored subject colored brightly among grungyness I like the straighton approach as well Seven from me Prediction 568
Are you kidding I doubt that anyone can improve on this lovely image The true charm lies with cute subject and its heartwarming expression The perching is outstanding The composition is complete and very well cropped
interesting not sure of the color although the gum trees are the subject they dont strike me as being the object with the composition
Interesting subject  Cant help but feel maybe black and white might have been better as the two greens seem to not go to well together Nice and sharp though
maybe try to make your subject more likenoticable its hard to look at this picture and see the fireflies
Great show of detail in original subject
I like this one the best so far  I love the way your little candid subject is dressed  It makes you think it could have been taken in another era Especially with the old sepia steps  I hope its doing really well for you
I see the subject but dont see a strong FP  Dont worry I think Im in the same boat  Good Luck
Good shot I like the persepctive for this subject and the lighting  The only thing that bothered me a little was the isolted tree growing between his legs  I may have shifted angles to avoid that
Good general idea but poorly thought out Theres a reason why you very rarely see shots like this  halfeaten food being eaten just is not appealing  Would have been far better to have had the model ABOUT to bite into a rack or ribs not in the process of gnawing on one
This has an excellent balance to it in my opinion and the gray suits your subject very well  I quite like the city off to the left the posts leading to it  Works for me
Other than that I do like the sense of motion and the rendering of a static subject into an abstract manner
Definitely a great inspirational set up Original quote Very nice The only nitpick I have is the dodge and burn around your subject and sky I suspect its intentional and thats ok its just not for me Im afraid
WOW how clever to produce an image like this Also where her subject matter in flora and fauma are sp limited and really hard to find ALso great processing skills
Cute subject and a good moment and I like the composition Not sure about the selective coloring or maybe thats just the toning but the sky has more saturation in it and I dont think that adds anything to the photo
Neat  Great job at keeping your subject centered in the zoom  9
Several things on this picture first I would put the back drop farther away from the subject to let it be able to be out of focus some lighting on the rope and hands would have helped to bring out some detail in the rope and I would have set this up or cropped it so none of the head was in the picture
Definitely meets the challenge and exhibits proper bokeh  The subject matter leaves me wanting not because its a flower  I have nothing against flowers  it just lacks a wow factor for me  Good luck
Being a Star Wars fan I obviously like the subject matter a lot My first suggestion though would be more dramatic lighting Its obvious mainly for Yoda that hes just a toy Instead of having a bright light taking away any shadows that might have been on him you could use more selective lighting Light side or dark its something dramatic give it some dramatic lighting Also I find the shadow of Vaders mask doesnt help since Yoda doesnt have one Nice try though good idea for sure
i see what you were going for but your subject just doesnt stand out in all the structures
I dont see any subject here
Your subject is black and white thus meets the challenge  Overall theres way too much color thus Im thinking the photo misses the spirit of the challenge   IMO
I simply dont like the subject of this challenge Some entries are more bearable than others
I liked this one just fine  I thought it a very good technical execution of the challenge ie a very good silhouette and I like your subject choice  and I love the tendrils  You may want to try a different crop  take away the tree and let the plant exist on its own and see if you like it
Oh yes  A passive subject helped but getting the composition right through angle of view and positioning was a considerable challenge  Lighting was difficult  Using natural light from a window and a mirror to reflect a little of that light into the shadow area it took much patience to create that soft shadow  Capturing the shiny flat surfaces without any distracting refelections was an achievement
First impression was Wow great stalagtites Second impressionWow great trees LOL Good job Need to pump up the highlights a bit though 8
3 Its metaphorically complex Its amazing that such a mundane subject material and a few oddsandends can produce such an example of visual stortytelling It has an air of documentary it has a heavy aura of science fiction It has hints of global domination it raises questions in my mind as to whether the tacks are a malevolent or a beneficient force and it speaks for me at least to the loneliness of the human condition and our quest for meaning in the universe Quite a load for a handful of tacks to tote eh
This is one of may favourites a great subject framed really well by the trees
That is a truly ugly shade  Was the ground really that color or did you manipulate it  The orange ring is kind of nice but the subject is too small to make out any detail
pretty colors but boring subject
Cant really make out any images here Idea around Bokeh is to highlight a subject via the out of focus One can Almost make out something in the top left but thats almost  Title doesnt really give a hint what to look for either sorry
I can see Bokeh but I cant see how the subject is enhanced by the bokeh of the background
Excellent impression of the hand Not an easy technique
thanks to those that got this image and to the rest who just cant understand that a subject does not need to be a lump of metal  open your eyes P
Very interesting rendering of the subject slot canyon country rock perhaps rotated 90 degrees
Very original and well done using such a mundane subject to turn it into a nice icture
a stretch on the subject
The subject is a little dark but still a nice photo 7
Your dirty or choas is to conservative dishes are still in the dish washer the cupboards are still closed nothing is smashed not even the beer can that looks opened What is the point with the iron bit He should be trying to use it or have something with the iron impression on it that wouldnt normally have an iron used on it Your trying to convey a nervous break down but its not very clear It seems more like a fun messy scene
Good workmanlike photo of a subject I dont personally find very interesting
Your main subject doesnt offer up much of a punch though Theres a slight focus issue I dont know if a different composition would have given this more power or if there needs to be something else in the photo
I thought it was illegal to have the main subject of your image be another photograph
Enjoy the subject and point of focus One of my favorites in this challenge
Interesting  In general I enjoy images of buildings that are in the process of falling down but I found the light colored panel in the lower left corner distracting  Also the window might be better placed within the image if you cropped a bit off the top
I like this shotbut I wish it were a larger size so that I could comment on some of the more technical aspects  I think that if you submit to a larger size youll find that you score better  Good positioning and interesting subject thoughgreat lighting
Excellant DOF control but the subject is slighty affected by it A different angle and slightly more focal length would have solved the problem and made this a top contender in my opinion
Back to comment Sorry to be so blunt but this image doesnt really convey Simple Pleasures to me  On the technical side your image has a couple of compositional issues that could be improved  First the cropping is a little tight to the scarecrows hat at the top of the image  Second the placement of the scarecrow should be more to the left so it is looking into the negative space in the image instead of away from the negative space  I suggest you review the winning images in the Rule of Thirds challenge to get a better feel for subject placement
Great portrait Very cute subject too Lovely tones and a good choice to go with BW
interesting subject but it seems way over saturated and cropped a little too low as the top of the left building is cut off
A great technical photo  The subject done not draw me in
Color is really eye catching in this one Well done Would have liked to see the subject a little further to the right for balance but a nice shot all the same
What a happy picture  Fabulous spring colors  Shes precious  That being said I find the subject and content wonderful but am not thinking wow  look at the lighting on this
Though I know the window is supposed to add to the ambience it seems distracting overpowers the subject  the praying girl
a good still life but my eye is torn between which pot is the subject of this photo
A perfect subject Id have like to have seen the subject incense boat in better focus
Flowers are a wonderful subject and you have exploited the lighting exquisitely  Good work
This is a beautiful creamy blue shot  With the subject only filling up the middle 15 th of the image I cant help but feel like a tighter crop would make a stronger statement While this is pretty to look at this doesnt really make me want to drink Absolut Its not outstanding for me
delicate and lovely  such a suitable process for this gorgeous subject  good luck in the challenge  
I love the image but except for the general shape see no relevance to the challenge theme I suppose this was a water balloon caught in the act of bursting I truly admire the skill required to catch this in midpop as they say
astretching the skin meaning just a bit bI dont find grass in and of itself a terribly appealing subject  sorry
This image is pushed to its graphical representation The general effect is good and to have made the eyes match would have given it that extra edge The attempt and execution is nice bumping up
Love this subject and the light and dark contrast
I like it Texture is the subject but it isnt monotonous because you have added interest with the large water drop on the top right and I like the colors here
I would added some contrast before converting to duotones The tulip doesnt stand out as much as it should in order to be the main subject of the photo your DOF is great though
Its an OK photograph I guess but Im afraid I feel the subject is just not interesting enough to be worth shooting  Of course several others also felt a candle was a worthy subject  I dont know if that vindicates my position or yours  Anyway I cant rate it highly Im afraid  Sorry 4
I find the fender of the auto very distracting and would have cropped it off  without hesitation Nice model nice expression  And given the difficulties posed by lighting its well lit  The eaves and downspout still pose problems because they are the only places in the photo where high contrast exists and the eye is drawn from the subject to this place out at the edge of the photo
ok shell cd b better subject
Nice one maybe having more of the glove and less of the tree would have helped but exposition for the subject and DOF are really good
very nice idea the subject isnt particularly exciting but you got a very good pic here
I get the impression that guy is being overrun  Great shot
great subject and reflection is nice but something doesnt look quite right oversharpening exposure etc  not sure though
Unbelievable tricks under basic editing For composition consider having your subject somewhere off center
A very clever look at crayons and colored pencils  the image meets the subject matter dead on with subtle yet detailed effect A terrific demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge in a very unusual way Should be a sure bet to win a ribbon or place high as a top twenty image  A couple of minor detail problems not worth mentioning because they dont appear until you really get a critical eye and examine the image closely  Well done
I wish the framing allowed for the entire subject to be visiblemaybe that wasnt possible
I like this one a lot Sharp all over with crisp details The tonal range is all over the zones The thing i like the most is that the subject is so simple and effective The Ansel Adams style is present in the image in all the aspects except the choice of subject and thats IMHO the true spirit of the challenge
Fantastic bokeh  Nice vignette  Subtle subject  a pretty damn good photograph
The short definition of Bokeh from KenRockwellcom which I am using for voting on this challenge Bokeh describes the rendition of outoffocus points of light There might be a case to be made for bokeh on the highlit side of the baby but its marginal Is the subject enhanced by the bokeh of the background I dont believe there is a relationship between the bokeh as defined and the foreground To me this is just a shallow DOF shot
Needs a subject to me
much to dark i would prefer  to have a singular subject or somthing imeadiatly obvious
Maybe a little too loosely composed  Not a single illuminative subject in my mind  Needs some better focus too  Try a tripod for slow shutter speeds on self timer if you dont have a release cable to prevent camera shake  Also need to have a little less exposure to keep the candle from blowing out as this one did
Excellent colours I like the diagonal composition And an interesting subject for sure
The subject is underexposed With some cameras you may need to place the subject in the center of the viewfinder depress the shutter halfway and while keeping the shutter depressed and reframe the shot to get the camera to expose for the correct item
I dont like this one because the object in the back is so blurry that it doesnt appear that it should even be in the photo Secondly the object in the front looks to be a drawing So if you take away the object in the front the photo would be a poor one I might not get it though so sorry for my low score Ok this is a great comment Very specific info here It brings into question choices of focus dof and even again the composition If my main subject is the dragon than this tells me that viewers are confused about that due to the way that I have presented the image Maybe Ive included elements that are not supportive of the concept of the image This gives me lots of food for thought to look at and self critique my shot
Lacking contrast for me  And cant help feel the subject is falling out of the frame  distracting
A masterful gathering of ideas subject and technique to bring about this beautiful work which despite the challenge theme bears a lovely uplifting feel Congratulations on your well earned blue
Nice tonesinteresting subject matter  Love this one
The bokeh is very nice but the main subject is not very strong
what is the subject 
Sometimes a theme invokes a different idea or concept and this is clearly one of those images which meet the challenge subject in completely different fashion than one might normally expect A great idea which falls short of perfection The overally flat tones and color detracts from the subjects impact The DOF control is sound and effective If this image could have been tone mapped it would have helped tremendously and probably would have been a ribbon contender A good solid entry into the challenge
A good portrait  I think a tighter crop on the subject would add some punch
Meets challenge very well  take a photograph whose subject is enhanced by the bokeh of the background Beautiful  I also love the expressions  very prof models or this couple is really close  for real
Good subject for the challenge and very striking
I think this is a great image  just misplaced in the challenge The subject matter appears to me to be the wood pilings and not the flora surrounding them  The overall color tone is interesting and subtle However the net effect isnt positive for me
Nice work capturing the subject in unusual conditions The icicles add much interest here
I might  have cropped a bit off the top to pull the subject in a bit more but this is lovely
The subject is clear but of little interest to me  Gave it a five and think your guess might be pretty close  52
Yes clearly stationery and with a poignantly depicted message that rends the heart Colors shapes and subject matter are well composed and understood
Im surprised this did so badly  looks like a very common impressionistic subject matter treated in a beautiful way  Mind you  Im surprised my shot is right next to this too 
I would argue that the child not the tree is the main subject of this image If the tree were the main subject it would not be cut off
Tim is there NO subject you are not EXCELLENT at  Congrats on the HM
Your chosen subject aside the composition could be a lot better the negative space at the top in particular and the angle at which you are addressing the subject  as I have found to my peril images that are very flat without much sense of depth tend to do badly
note sure about the colouring but I like the subject
I like your subject and composition  It appears a little dark overall  I checked it on 2 different monitors to be sure  I hope that info is helpful  Getting photographs too dark is one of my pitfalls
The photographer was bored but the subject is a window
I would have preferred a sharper focus The subject doesnt really fit with the challenge theme
Youve caught your subject in a great action photo position but photographically hes overwhelmed by the wave and its difficult to determine exactly whats happening
Nice subject here and good composition Focus is soft and the light background appears smudgy The effect of those two items detract significantly
Great subject for this wonderful portrait
i think youve done a good job capturing the subject
Great timing and dof but subject is too similar to background colour texture
Looks yummy   We just used some of our tomatoes last night TMI Im curious whether taking out a bit of yellow might make it even yummier  I also wonder if moving the subject up a tiny tiny bit in that crop might help the composition 6
I like the use of the other item which became the subject of a candel and its holder well done very interesting
There is definitely a line and it is highlighted nicely  The subject isnt incredibly intriguing to me so I dont feel a strong pull  5
Nice subject and nice job on the exposure
Interesting subject choice but I feel the lighting doesnt quite work and the background is not effective
While the water is calm the overall impression is one of busy to me
The subject is just too smallI wouldnt know what it was without the title
I like the shot but I have two issues with this picture one is the main subject is too centered second is very hard to find sadness in here 5
Im editing this to change it from a comment that just said 6 to what I really wanted to type  and no 6 isnt your score  Here are my real comments I like this image its a wonderful black and white with great tones and a wonderful rhythm to the patterns especially in the benches  I found Waldo fairly quickly but thats not my test for this challenge Im actually looking for interesting images Part of what I like here is the general emptiness you captured without making it feel cold Its waiting anticipating not lonely Nice I give it an 8
Interesting take  subject being all white in stark contrast to the fiery fall colors bokeh Magnificent being nicely captured
I see some fantastic architectures here I just wish there was a subject at the end of the colonade would help focus the eye
does not thrill me or give me a good since of what you are going for  very little subject in huge area
I would say the ant is the subject here not the sand  otherwise not bad
Three things hold this image back and keep a wonderful subject from really catching the viewers interest
The hand is the subject  buit hard to get in the right place and isolated within the rustic setting
This image could use just a little bit of curves to really enhance the lines  Its more of a subject study which renders it kind of static but it has some potential
Interesting idea however my eye is drawn away from the subject and directly to the sun i think a different angle could have really made this shot stand out more still cool idea good shot 6
peonie for subject is a good choice a interesting asymetrical shape offsets central placement  This is a good study w soft dark back and soft light
This is one of the most original entries and I would love to see it rated high However subject sorry  main subject  is so hard to present as a piece of art  thats where I struggle  trying to rate it properly Maybe Im too picky  forgive me
this is a perfect idea for a billboard but for it to really work there are a couple things you would need to do differently  your subject looks great up close but is too small to really come across at 60 mph this is one challenge where you have to look at the thumbnails to get a feeling for what it would look like on the roadwell looking at the thumbs is easier than putting the pc out in the yard and running back and forth  another consideration is that the more effective billboards are laid out from left to right with the graphics on the left and the verbiage on the right  all the same you have an image that gets the point across  good luck in the challenge
I think this fits the topic best While not the best picture it a nice contrasting image between the two subject and to see how far society has taken us
seems a little too closely cropped but thats a good choice of subject
Excellent choice of subject and point of view  I love the colors of the bricks  The ice seems to have helped light the under side of the bridge  A 10
nice image well photographedit would be hard to go wrong with this subject
Interesting composition  Apple the main subject for the challenge is a little too dark and soft in focus
Nice shot  Great color  I like that the subject remains anonymous
Overall it is an appealing image that succeeds on first impression and provides interest and composition to hold attention and encourage a longer look
Beautiful job Very nice colors  The subject being just off center is very effective
Your subject face is although not washed out much too bright for the dark background Id suggest standing further back and then cropping 5
Wow  I didnt expect the subject matter to get such a reaction  The entry was meant to be somewhat tongue in cheek  I realise that many people still use 35mm and that it still has certain advantages over digital  However it became obsolete for me soon after I bought my first digital SLR and I suspect the same is true for many who submit to this site  so I figured that it fitted the challenge
Very nice work my favorite of the lot I love your use of blur on the trees to create the impression of depth Watch out for light direction though if the moon is supposed to be the main only source the trees on the right should be totally dark Not a big deal of course 
Very apt subject perfectly captured
A pleasant pastoral scene with plenty of different elements to make it interesting but not so many that they become overwhelming Composition is fine although the large tree on the right is on the verge of being overbearing Overall a great subject that evokes a peaceful feeling but with a nice undercurrent of excitement from the clouds Id call your light hunt successful
beautiful great use of bokeh to make your subject a wonderful image
Sweet shot dude  Gorgeous bokeh  I like your blatant disregard for the rule of thirds too as your subject is in the extreme corner of the frame  Ive always secretly hated the rule of thirds  Well done  Congrats on top 20
I like it Ive always loved photos where the thing that should be te subject isnt in focus Good job
A two for one special the wall of the bridge at left leads me right to the subject as does the patch of green and the waterso actually that is threenope the line of the trees at right lead me there towell sort ofbut it is one of the better examples Ive seen so far great colorsexposure on top of it and reflections of the bridge in the water Supermy only possible nit is that the bit of white fencing to the right of the bridge just seems out of place but it is as found so Ill let it go Good luck
Good use of shadows to lead into the subject but you have cropped most of the subject off leaving only the shadows Could have been nice to see more of what I assume is trees silhouetted against water
Hard subject great idea
These look like the fingers of a guitar player are those callouses  But in that case the fingers are numbered incorrectly for the fingering charts  Id rather see an image of the subject actually applying the numbers  It just doesnt do it for me subjectwise  Sorry
Beauty is a subjective thing I know  In my scoring and comments Im trying to score based on NOT whether or not I would think a particular subject beautiful but on whether the photographer has succeeded in creating a beautiful photo  I look for the elements of color lines focus and dof interest lighting  and a certain element of grace and lovlieness   Im looking for a unique and creative  appeal for the highest scorers   This is what Im putting at the start of all of my comments  and I hope it is helpful
Good concept and I like the lighting  I would like to see a dirtier subject to help the idea along
WOW effect and first impression 012  1
Like the choice of BW here You have nice texture of the skin BG compliments your subject well 7
Would have been more appealing to me if the DOF took in all of the subject or was wide on the foot but in between
dont know what it would look like had you kept a water line like the equivalent of a horizon try it who knows though i guess you were aiming for something disappearing in darkness Though perhaps if you  a water line it wouldnt have the feel of being so dark that you have the false impression its not as sharp as it really is cf comment below
This one really moved me The stance of your subject and the tracks in the snow tell a tale of its own Very nice
Not a compelling or interesting subject when compared to the 500 other entries  Keep trying though
Your title is the chapel but the fence is the dominant subject and the chapel is not in focus
I like big sky picturesbut Im having a hard time focusing on anything in this shot  I wish there was one main subject or focal point but I find my eyes wandering all over and never finding anything to settle on  Parts of the sky are blown out as well  Maybe try bracketing next time
A complete artistic success this image is negatively affected by being over sharpened which is immediately noticable in particular around the edges of the subject and the subjects hat This only increases the rather flat colors of the subject A little more time taken while composing would have only benefitted this image positively While there are some very noticable technical flaws the artistic impression over comes these flaws in a very effective presentation Well done
This image seems oversharpened but its an outstanding subject for stock photography with excellent color
Interesting subject matterthe light is rather harsh and uglya softer more directional light source could have brought out more of those lovely texturescreated more depth IMO
An image that demonstates the subject matter of the challenge in good fashion with excellant DOF and color control A little more saturation would have helped the visual impact A technical and artistic success that more than adequately meets the challenge subject in particular with the color shading
Good general image but seems a bit too soft focused through out This may have held up well with a stronger tonemapping kind of processing
I like the subject but the image just seems too dark
I only learned about flip and bend by poking around the forums here What I like about this one is how completely abstract it appears until you reveal what the subject is then is like a smack in the forehead  Doh Of course  why couldnt I see it
Great photo although maybe the subject could have taken up a bit less of the scene
Hmm A small photo of a mundane subject with mundane lighting I dont have high hopes for this one Surely you could find more interesting light  subject somewhere
144 out of 235 This is unbelievable This is a beautiful picture and I really liked your choice to selective desat in different way by choosing subject to be bw over background
Nice exposure but the subject matter just doesnt hold my attention
I am giving this a higher mark than I normally would for something like this because it has a great quality to it and meets the challenge very well with out having the subject in your face
The idea is brilliant but the image lacks overall sharpness a bit of saturation on the subject and some contrast darker if not pitch black background It would have been a striking image
Needs some separation between the subject and background good DOF though  The subject should be a little lighter and have a little more contrast the dark background is ok as is
Good subject Horse on the right is a nice shape  I would have liked to have seen this one on its own for a stronger image
good bokeh but subject is not the most exciting  well composed
this is a very overall grey which gives the impression of empty ness
Interesting subject indeed
The position of the subject is a bit disturbing like the desat it works well to draw viewer to the eyes
My first impression was a good one Great visible textures
Hmmm that guy could use some different shortsbut seriousl the image looks too soft overall  The main subject should be sharp
A bit bright on the highlights throughout and the general composition is just a bit too busy I know how hard it is to shoot these birds Blown highlights and cruddy backgrounds plague me a swell
